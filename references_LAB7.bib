	abstract = {Recent data on prevalence, awareness, treatment, and risk factors of diabetes in China is necessary for interventional efforts. To estimate trends in prevalence, awareness, treatment, and risk factors of diabetes in China based on national data. Cross-sectional nationally representative survey data collected in adults aged 18 years or older in mainland China from 170 287 participants in the 2013-2014 years and 173 642 participants in the 2018-2019 years. Fasting plasma glucose and hemoglobin A1c levels were measured for all participants. A 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test was conducted for all participants without diagnosed diabetes. Primary outcomes were diabetes and prediabetes defined according to American Diabetes Association criteria. Secondary outcomes were awareness, treatment, and control of diabetes and prevalence of risk factors. A hemoglobin A1c level of less than 7.0\% (53 mmol/mol) among treated patients with diabetes was considered adequate glycemic control. In 2013, the median age was 55.8 years (IQR, 46.4-65.2 years) and the weighted proportion of women was 50.0\%; in 2018, the median age was 51.3 years (IQR, 42.1-61.6 years), and the weighted proportion of women was 49.5\%. The estimated prevalence of diabetes increased from 10.9\% (95\% CI, 10.4\%-11.5\%) in 2013 to 12.4\% (95\% CI, 11.8\%-13.0\%) in 2018 (P {!'} .001). The estimated prevalence of prediabetes was 35.7\% (95\% CI, 34.2\%-37.3\%) in 2013 and 38.1\% (95\% CI, 36.4\%-39.7\%) in 2018 (P = .07). In 2018, among adults with diabetes, 36.7\% (95\% CI, 34.7\%-38.6\%) reported being aware of their condition, and 32.9\% (95\% CI, 30.9\%-34.8\%) reported being treated; 50.1\% (95\% CI, 47.5\%-52.6\%) of patients receiving treatment were controlled adequately. These rates did not change significantly from 2013. From 2013 to 2018, low physical activity, high intake of red meat, overweight, and obesity significantly increased in prevalence. In this survey study, the estimated diabetes prevalence was high and increased from 2013 to 2018. There was no significant improvement in the estimated prevalence of adequate treatment.},

	abstract = {To characterize challenges experienced during stages of female-to-male sex transition and investigate associations between transition-specific measures of psychosocial stress, nocturnal decline in ambulatory blood pressure (amBP), and changes in C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. For this biocultural study, 65 healthy transmen who were using testosterone (T) therapy participated in interviews to assess transition-specific stress experience. They provided perceived stress scores, self-esteem scores, 24-h amBP measures, salivary samples for T levels, and a blood spot for CRP levels. Psychosocial stress was examined in relation to amBP and CRP using linear regression while adjusting for age, body mass index, and smoking. There were no differences in mean levels of amBP in association with stage of transition. Men reporting stress associated with being ``out'' as transgender had significantly diminished nocturnal decline in systolic and diastolic amBP compared to men who did not report such stress. The associations remained significant when examined among men in stages 1 and 2 (≤3 years on T), but not among men in stage 3 (¿3 years on T) of transition. Men reporting stress related to ``passing'' as someone born male had higher CRP levels than those who did not report such stress. The association remained significant when examined among men in stages 2 and 3 (¿0.5--3 years on T). Measures of stress that captured individuals' experiences of gender liminality were associated with diminished nocturnal decline in amBP and increased levels of CRP. There are significant differences between men grouped into different stages of the transition process. Am. J. Hum. Biol., 2012. {\copyright} 2011Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Transgender and gender diverse (TGD) people are increasingly visible in U.S. communities and in national media. With this increased visibility, access to gender affirming healthcare is also on the rise, particularly for urban youth. Political backlash and entrenchment in a gender binary, however, continue to marginalize TGD people, increasing risk for health disparities. The 2016 National Institute of Health recognition of sexual and gender minority people as a health disparities population increases available funding for much‐needed research. In this article, we speak to the need for a biocultural human biology of gender/sex diversity by delineating factors that influence physiological functioning, mental health, and physical health of TGD people. We propose that many of these factors can best be investigated with minimally invasively collected biomarker samples (MICBS) and discuss how to integrate MICBS into research inclusive of TGD people. Research use of MICBS among TGD people remains limited, and wider use could enable essential biological and health data to be collected from a population often excluded from research. We provide a broad overview of terminology and current literature, point to key research questions, and address potential challenges researchers might face when aiming to integrate MCIBS in research inclusive of transgender and gender diverse people. We argue that, when used effectively, MICBS can enhance human biologists' ability to empirically measure physiology and health‐related outcomes and enable more accurate identification of pathways linking human experience, embodiment, and health.},

	abstract = {The current study examined facets of gender minority stress (nonaffirmation, internalized transphobia) and protective factors (community connectedness, transgender identity pride) as potential moderators of the relationship between sexual victimization and sleep disturbances among transgender and gender nonconforming (TGNC) adults. TGNC adults (n = 191) were recruited through Amazon's Mechanical Turk. The average age was 30.28 years old (SD = 7.09; range 18--71) and the majority (55\%) identified in the transfemale spectrum. Results demonstrated a significant two‐way interaction between sexual victimization and internalized transphobia, such that sexual victimization was more strongly related to sleep disturbances when internalized transphobia was low (β = .14, p = .017) relative to high (β = −0.09, p = .221). This study is the first to establish the relationship between sexual victimization and sleep disturbances in TGNC individuals. Additional research is needed to replicate these findings longitudinally.},

	abstract = {Background Blood pressure variability (BPV) describes visit-to-visit blood pressure (BP) changes independent of hypertension. Preoperative BPV and intraoperative BPV are associated with increased postoperative outcomes. We investigated the impact of both preoperative BPV and intraoperative BPV on elective surgical outcomes, specifically whether preoperative BPV and intraoperative BPV were independent risk factors for surgical complications. Materials and Methods We investigated 600 patients undergoing elective surgery lasting more than two h and who had ≥8 outpatient BP recordings over three preoperative years. Age, sex, ethnicity, BMI, current medical problems, and medications at time of surgery were recorded. BPV was calculated as the standard deviation (SD) of systolic or diastolic BP for the 369 valid patients. Average BPV were compared between adverse outcomes of readmission, wound infection, acute kidney injury, death, myocardial infarction, and cerebral vascular accident. Results Three-hundred-sixty-nine (52.6\% male, 47.4\% female, 98.1\% non--Hispanic) patients (mean age 62.5) were included in the study. Preoperative systolic (P = 0.043) and diastolic (P = 0.009) BPV were higher for patients with the combined endpoint of all adverse events. Preoperative systolic BPV was correlated with intraoperative BPV (P = 0.010). Both systolic and diastolic preoperative BPV was found to be independent from intraoperative BPV. Otolaryngology procedures were associated with less adverse outcomes (P = 0.034), while antimicrobials (P = 0.022), autonomic drugs (P {!'} 0.001), or respiratory drugs (P = 0.032) was associated with an increased likelihood of adverse outcome. Conclusion Preoperative DBPV is associated with increased risk of readmission, wound infection and the combined endpoint of all adverse events. Intraoperative systolic blood pressure variability (SPBV) is associated with increased risk of acute kidney injury and the combined endpoint of all adverse events. Preoperative DBPV and intraoperative SBPV are independent risk factors for ninety-d postoperative outcomes. BPV should be considered in individualized risk assessment when assessing patient eligibility for elective procedures.},

	abstract = {This study assessed diurnal cortisol functioning in relation to stigma-based transition-specific stressors experienced by transgender men during their transition from female to male. Sixty-five healthy transgender men undergoing testosterone therapy participated in in-person interviews through which transition-specific stressors were identified. Interviews were coded according to participant reported (1) Transitioning-identity stress; (2) Coming Out stress; (3) Gender-specific Public Bathroom stress; and (4) levels of general Perceived Stress. Participants provided fifteen salivary samples assessing cortisol diurnal rhythm over three days. Hierarchical linear models, adjusted for duration of time on testosterone therapy, body mass index, steroid-related medication use, mean awakening time, and CAR, confirmed that elevated diurnal cortisol levels at awakening were associated with transition-specific social stressors including experiencing Transitioning-identity stress, frequent Coming Out stress, and Gender-specific Public Bathroom stress. Transitioning-identity stress and Gender-specific Public Bathroom stress also predicted a steeper negative slope at awakening. General Perceived Stress was not associated with elevated cortisol or slope. These results clarify the relation of increased cortisol at awakening with a negative linear slope to perceived stigma and transition-related stress experience among transgender men.},

@article{10.1037/a0035302,
	abstract = {Major life stressors, especially those involving interpersonal stress and social rejection, are among the strongest proximal risk factors for depression. In this review, we propose a biologically plausible, multilevel theory that describes neural, physiologic, molecular, and genomic mechanisms that link experiences of social-environmental stress with internal biological processes that drive depression pathogenesis. Central to this social signal transduction theory of depression is the hypothesis that experiences of social threat and adversity up-regulate components of the immune system involved in inflammation. The key mediators of this response, called proinflammatory cytokines, can in turn elicit profound changes in behavior, which include the initiation of depressive symptoms such as sad mood, anhedonia, fatigue, psychomotor retardation, and social-behavioral withdrawal. This highly conserved biological response to adversity is critical for survival during times of actual physical threat or injury. However, this response can also be activated by modern-day social, symbolic, or imagined threats, leading to an increasingly proinflammatory phenotype that may be a key phenomenon driving depression pathogenesis and recurrence, as well as the overlap of depression with several somatic conditions including asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic pain, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and neurodegeneration. Insights from this theory may thus shed light on several important questions including how depression develops, why it frequently recurs, why it is strongly predicted by early life stress, and why it often co-occurs with symptoms of anxiety and with certain physical disease conditions. This work may also suggest new opportunities for preventing and treating depression by targeting inflammation.},

	abstract = {Blood pressure is characterized by short-term and long-term fluctuations, which are the result of complex interactions between environmental and behavioural factors, on the one side, and cardiovascular regulatory mechanisms on the other. Increased blood pressure variability (BPV) leads to cardiac, vascular, and renal damage and has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Parati et al. review the mechanisms, assessment and prognostic importance of BPV. They also address the question of whether BPV should be a target for antihypertensive treatment in the prevention of cardiovascular disease. Blood pressure (BP) is characterized by marked short-term fluctuations occurring within a 24 h period (beat-to-beat, minute-to-minute, hour-to-hour, and day-to-night changes) and also by long-term fluctuations occurring over more-prolonged periods of time (days, weeks, months, seasons, and even years). Rather than representing 'background noise' or a randomly occurring phenomenon, these variations have been shown to be the result of complex interactions between extrinsic environmental and behavioural factors and intrinsic cardiovascular regulatory mechanisms. Although the adverse cardiovascular consequences of hypertension largely depend on absolute BP values, evidence from observational studies and post-hoc analyses of data from clinical trials have indicated that these outcomes might also depend on increased BP variability (BPV).

Inflammation is now appreciated to have an important role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and associated complications. Donath describes the underlying mechanisms and discusses the rationale for the use of anti-inflammatory agents --- such as those that have been developed for rheumatoid arthritis and other diseases driven by inflammatory processes --- in patients with diabetes. The role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and associated complications is now well established. Several conditions that are driven by inflammatory processes are also associated with diabetes, including rheumatoid arthritis, gout, psoriasis and Crohn's disease, and various anti-inflammatory drugs have been approved or are in late stages of development for the treatment of these conditions. This Review discusses the rationale for the use of some of these anti-inflammatory treatments in patients with diabetes and what we could expect from their use. Future immunomodulatory treatments may not target a specific disease, but could instead act on a dysfunctional pathway that causes several conditions associated with the metabolic syndrome.},

	abstract = {Significance We describe a readily exportable method for noninvasive imaging of the pancreatic inflammation underlying type-1 diabetes (T1D), based on MRI of the clinically approved magnetic nanoparticle ferumoxytol. This approach, which reflects nanoparticle uptake by macrophages in the inflamed pancreatic lesion, has been validated rigorously in mouse T1D models. Methodological advances reported here include extensive optimization of image acquisition and improved MRI registration and visualization technologies. A proof-of-principle study revealed a clear difference in whole-pancreas nanoparticle accumulation in patients with recent-onset T1D versus healthy controls and pronounced intra- and interpancreatic signal heterogeneity in patients. Noninvasive generation of 3D, high-resolution maps of pancreatic inflammation should prove invaluable in assessing T1D progression and as an indicator of response to therapy.},

	abstract = {This article reviews a growing body of research that examines sleep among lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) populations. An extensive search of the literature was conducted using multiple medical and psychological search engine platforms. In total, this search yielded 31 reports that included sleep data collected from sexual and gender minority participants. Overall, research findings are mixed and include several publications of studies conducted in the same sample. Our review suggests that sleep health among LGBT individuals may be an unmet health need. Critically, sleep disturbances affected LGBT subgroups differently based on sex/gender and diverse sexual orientations (e.g., bisexual women). Although not directly tested, evidence from parallel LGBT health research suggests that minority stress may contribute to these observed sleep disparities and will need to be directly assessed in future studies. In sum, continued investigation of sleep disparities among sexual and gender minority communities is needed, as is the inclusion of sleep health in theoretical models of LGBT health disparities. Given the importance of sleep in overall mental and physical health, addressing sleep health may serve to promote and protect healthy functioning among LGBT individuals.},

	abstract = {Objective To systematically review studies quantifying the associations of long term (clinic), mid-term (home), and short term (ambulatory) variability in blood pressure, independent of mean blood pressure, with cardiovascular disease events and mortality. Data sources Medline, Embase, Cinahl, and Web of Science, searched to 15 February 2016 for full text articles in English. Eligibility criteria for study selection Prospective cohort studies or clinical trials in adults, except those in patients receiving haemodialysis, where the condition may directly impact blood pressure variability. Standardised hazard ratios were extracted and, if there was little risk of confounding, combined using random effects meta-analysis in main analyses. Outcomes included all cause and cardiovascular disease mortality and cardiovascular disease events. Measures of variability included standard deviation, coefficient of variation, variation independent of mean, and average real variability, but not night dipping or day-night variation. Results 41 papers representing 19 observational cohort studies and 17 clinical trial cohorts, comprising 46 separate analyses were identified. Long term variability in blood pressure was studied in 24 papers, mid-term in four, and short-term in 15 (two studied both long term and short term variability). Results from 23 analyses were excluded from main analyses owing to high risks of confounding. Increased long term variability in systolic blood pressure was associated with risk of all cause mortality (hazard ratio 1.15, 95\% confidence interval 1.09 to 1.22), cardiovascular disease mortality (1.18, 1.09 to 1.28), cardiovascular disease events (1.18, 1.07 to 1.30), coronary heart disease (1.10, 1.04 to 1.16), and stroke (1.15, 1.04 to 1.27). Increased mid-term and short term variability in daytime systolic blood pressure were also associated with all cause mortality (1.15, 1.06 to 1.26 and 1.10, 1.04 to 1.16, respectively). Conclusions Long term variability in blood pressure is associated with cardiovascular and mortality outcomes, over and above the effect of mean blood pressure. Associations are similar in magnitude to those of cholesterol measures with cardiovascular disease. Limited data for mid-term and short term variability showed similar associations. Future work should focus on the clinical implications of assessment of variability in blood pressure and avoid the common confounding pitfalls observed to date.

	abstract = {Background--- The metabolic syndrome describes a high-risk population having 3 or more of the following clinical characteristics: upper-body obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL, hypertension, and abnormal glucose. All of these attributes, however, are associated with increased levels of C-reactive protein (CRP). Methods and Results--- We evaluated interrelationships between CRP, the metabolic syndrome, and incident cardiovascular events among 14 719 apparently healthy women who were followed up for an 8-year period for myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization, or cardiovascular death; 24\% of the cohort had the metabolic syndrome at study entry. At baseline, median CRP levels for those with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 characteristics of the metabolic syndrome were 0.68, 1.09, 1.93, 3.01, 3.88, and 5.75 mg/L, respectively (Ptrend {!'}0.0001). Over the 8-year follow-up, cardiovascular event-free survival rates based on CRP levels above or below 3.0 mg/L were similar to survival rates based on having 3 or more characteristics of the metabolic syndrome. At all levels of severity of the metabolic syndrome, however, CRP added prognostic information on subsequent risk. For example, among those with the metabolic syndrome at study entry, age-adjusted incidence rates of future cardiovascular events were 3.4 and 5.9 per 1000 person-years of exposure for those with baseline CRP levels less than or greater than 3.0 mg/L, respectively. Additive effects for CRP were also observed for those with 4 or 5 characteristics of the metabolic syndrome. The use of different definitions of the metabolic syndrome had minimal impact on these findings. Conclusions--- These prospective data suggest that measurement of CRP adds clinically important prognostic information to the metabolic syndrome.},

	abstract = {Background---We examined the development of new diabetes mellitus in men aged 45 to 64 years during the West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study. Methods and Results---Our definition of diabetes mellitus was based on the American Diabetic Association threshold of a blood glucose level of ≥7.0 mmol/L. Subjects who self-reported diabetes at baseline or had a baseline glucose level of ≥7.0 mmol/L were excluded from the analyses. A total of 5974 of the 6595 randomized subjects were included in the analysis, and 139 subjects became diabetic during the study. The baseline predictors of the transition from normal glucose control to diabetes were studied. In the univariate model, body mass index, log triglyceride, log white blood cell count, systolic blood pressure, total and HDL cholesterol, glucose, and randomized treatment assignment to pravastatin were significant predictors. In a multivariate model, body mass index, log triglyceride, glucose, and pravastatin therapy were retained as predictors of diabetes in this cohort. Conclusions---We concluded that the assignment to pravastatin therapy resulted in a 30\% reduction (P=0.042) in the hazard of becoming diabetic. By lowering plasma triglyceride levels, pravastatin therapy may favorably influence the development of diabetes, but other explanations, such as the anti-inflammatory properties of this drug in combination with its endothelial effects, cannot be excluded with these analyses.},

	abstract = {Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is major cardiovascular disease that causes high morbidity and mortality. In AMI, ischemia and necrosis affected some cardiomyocytes leading to a decrease in myocardial contractility which is followed by an acute proinflammation reaction and increased sympathetic tone. Meanwhile, high blood pressure variability (BPV) causing an increased left ventricular workload, heart rate, myocardial oxygen demand and induces proinflamations and endothelial dysfunction. Therefore a high BPV and its associated pathological effects are likely to aggravate the physiological function of the heart and affect the emergence of acute cardiac complications in AMI patients. This study aims to investigate the association's between short-term BPV and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in AMI patients. This retrospective cohort study used simple random sampling to identify AMI patients who were hospitalized at Cipto Mangunkusumo National Hospital between January 2018 and December 2019. Mann Withney was performed to investigate the association between BPV and MACE. The average systolic BPV value which was calculated as standard deviation (SD) and average real variability (ARV) was higher in the MACE group than in the non-MACE group. Systolic SD and systolic ARV in the MACE group were 13.28 $\pm$ 5.41 mmHg and 9.88 $\pm$ 3.81 mmHg respectively. In the non-MACE group, systolic SD and systolic ARV were 10.76 (4.59--26.17) mmHg and 8.65 (3.22--19.35) mmHg respectively. There was no significant association between BPV and MACE. However, there were significant differences between systolic SD and systolic ARV in patients with hypertension who experienced MACE and patients without hypertension who experienced MACE. The BPV of AMI patients who experience MACE was higher than that of non-MACE AMI patients. There was no significant association between BPV and MACE during the acute phase of AMI.},

	abstract = {Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the inflammatory state in obese women displaying the ``metabolically healthy but obese'' (MHO) phenotype. Design: We examined the metabolic characteristics of 88 obese, sedentary postmenopausal women. Subjects were classified as MHO or as ``at risk'' based on the upper and lower quartiles of insulin sensitivity as measured by the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp technique. Thereafter, we determined 1) body composition, 2) body fat distribution, 3) plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels, 4) glucose homeostasis, 5) resting blood pressure, 6) peak oxygen consumption, and 7) inflammation markers as potential modulators of differences in the coronary risk profile. Results: Twenty-two MHO women displayed high insulin sensitivity (15.35 $\pm$ 2.3 mg/min·kg fat-free mass), and 22 at risk subjects with low insulin sensitivity (7.98 $\pm$ 1.4 mg/min·kg fat-free mass) were identified. Despite comparable total body fatness between groups (47.7 $\pm$ 4.8 vs. 45.5 $\pm$ 4.4\%; not significant), MHO individuals had significantly lower levels of visceral fat, fasting insulin, plasma triglycerides, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP), and α-1 antitrypsin levels and higher levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol than at risk individuals (P {!'} 0.05). Stepwise regression analysis showed that CRP, fasting triglycerides, and the lean body mass index explained 19.5, 8.5, and 4.0\%, respectively, of the variance observed in glucose disposal (total r2 = 0.320; P {!'} 0.001) Conclusion: Results of the present study indicate that postmenopausal women displaying the MHO phenotype also have a favorable inflammation profile as shown by lower CRP and α-1 antitrypsin levels compared with insulin-resistant women. This suggests that a lower inflammation state, as attested by low CRP levels, could play a role in the protective profile of the MHO individual, and this may be associated metabolically to a lower risk for cardiovascular disease.},

	abstract = {Logistical constraints associated with the collection and analysis of biological samples in community-based settings have been a significant impediment to integrative, multilevel biodemographic and biobehavioral research. However, recent methodological developments have overcome many of these constraints and have also expanded the options for incorporating biomarkers into population-based health research in international as well as domestic contexts. In particular, using dried blood spot (DBS) samples---drops of whole blood collected on filter paper from a simple finger prick--- provides a minimally invasive method for collecting blood samples in nonclinical settings. After a brief discussion of biomarkers more generally, we review procedures for collecting, handling, and analyzing DBS samples. Advantages of using DBS samples---compared with venipuncture---include the relative ease and low cost of sample collection, transport, and storage. Disadvantages include requirements for assay development and validation as well as the relatively small volumes of sample. We present the results of a comprehensive literature review of published protocols for analysis of DBS samples, and we provide more detailed analysis of protocols for 45 analytes likely to be of particular relevance to population-level health research. Our objective is to provide investigators with the information they need to make informed decisions regarding the appropriateness of blood spot methods for their research interests.},

	abstract = {In addition to mean blood pressure, blood pressure variability is hypothesized to have important prognostic value in evaluating cardiovascular risk. We aimed to assess the prognostic value of blood pressure variability within 24 hours. Using MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Library to April 2013, we conducted a systematic review of prospective studies of adults, with at least one year follow-up and any day, night or 24-hour blood pressure variability measure as a predictor of one or more of the following outcomes: all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, all cardiovascular events, stroke and coronary heart disease. We examined how blood pressure variability is defined and how its prognostic use is reported. We analysed relative risks adjusted for covariates including the appropriate mean blood pressure and considered the potential for meta-analysis. Our analysis of methods included 24 studies and analysis of predictions included 16 studies. There were 36 different measures of blood pressure variability and 13 definitions of night- and day-time periods. Median follow-up was 5.5 years (interquartile range 4.2--7.0). Comparing measures of dispersion, coefficient of variation was less well researched than standard deviation. Night dipping based on percentage change was the most researched measure and the only measure for which data could be meaningfully pooled. Night dipping or lower night-time blood pressure was associated with lower risk of cardiovascular events. The interpretation and use in clinical practice of 24-hour blood pressure variability, as an important prognostic indicator of cardiovascular events, is hampered by insufficient evidence and divergent methodologies.

	abstract = {Hyperosmotic stress is an often overlooked process that potentially contributes to a number of human diseases. Whereas renal hyperosmolarity is a well-studied phenomenon, recent research provides evidence that many non-renal tissues routinely experience hyperosmotic stress that may contribute significantly to disease initiation and progression. Moreover, a growing body of evidence implicates hyperosmotic stress as a potent inflammatory stimulus by triggering pro-inflammatory cytokine release and inflammation. Under physiological conditions, the urine concentrating mechanism within the inner medullary region of the mammalian kidney exposes cells to high extracellular osmolarity. As such, renal cells have developed many adaptive strategies to compensate for increased osmolarity. Hyperosmotic stress is linked to many maladies, including acute and chronic, as well as local and systemic, inflammatory disorders. Hyperosmolarity triggers cell shrinkage, oxidative stress, protein carbonylation, mitochondrial depolarization, DNA damage, and cell cycle arrest, thus rendering cells susceptible to apoptosis. However, many adaptive mechanisms exist to counter the deleterious effects of hyperosmotic stress, including cytoskeletal rearrangement and up-regulation of antioxidant enzymes, transporters, and heat shock proteins. Osmolyte synthesis is also up-regulated and many of these compounds have been shown to reduce inflammation. The cytoprotective mechanisms and associated regulatory pathways that accompany the renal response to hyperosmolarity are found in many non-renal tissues, suggesting cells are commonly confronted with hyperosmotic conditions. Osmoadaptation allows cells to survive and function under potentially cytotoxic conditions. This review covers the pathological consequences of hyperosmotic stress in relation to disease and emphasizes the importance of considering hyperosmolarity in inflammation and disease progression.},

	abstract = {Diabetes is a complex metabolic disorder affecting the glucose status of the human body. Chronic hyperglycaemia related to diabetes is associated with end organ failure. The clinical relationship between diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is well established. This makes therapeutic approaches that simultaneously target diabetes and atherosclerotic disease an attractive area for research. The majority of people with diabetes fall into two broad pathogenetic categories, type 1 or type 2 diabetes. The role of obesity, adipose tissue, gut microbiota and pancreatic beta cell function in diabetes are under intensive scrutiny with several clinical trials to have been completed while more are in development. The emerging role of inflammation in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes (T1D and T1D) pathophysiology and associated metabolic disorders, has generated increasing interest in targeting inflammation to improve prevention and control of the disease. After an extensive review of the possible mechanisms that drive the metabolic pattern in T1D and T2D and the inflammatory pathways that are involved, it becomes ever clearer that future research should focus on a model of combined suppression for various inflammatory response pathways.},

	abstract = {In recent years, there has been interest in evaluating the morbidity and mortality risk of circadian, diurnal, or noctur-nal blood pressure variation. Variation is a normative property of blood pressure, necessary for survival. Like many physio-logical functions, blood pressure undergoes allostasis, meaning that the body does not defend a particular blood pressure value, but rather blood pressure maintains bodi-ly stability through continual change that is initiated by constantly fluctuating internal and external environmental stimuli. Be-cause of its allostatic and adaptive properties, the blood pressure response to unusual situations like a visit to the clinic can lead to misdiagnosis of hypertension. However, blood pressure variation is mostly ignored when evaluating hypertension, which is an arbitrary dichotomy. Whether variation is indicative of pathology should be determined by assessing its appro-priateness for the circumstance, which requires quantification of the sources and extent of normative blood pressure respons-es to everyday living. These responses will vary among populations due to evolutionary genetic differences. The incon-sistency of reports regarding aspects of ambulatory blood pressure variation as cardiovascular risk factors likely results from the fact that the measures used do not reflect the actual nature of blood pressure allostasis.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major risk factor for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) for reasons that are unclear. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We leveraged the International Study of Inflammation in COVID-19 (ISIC), a multicenter observational study of 2,044 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, to characterize the impact of DM on in-hospital outcomes and assess the contribution of inflammation and hyperglycemia to the risk attributed to DM. We measured biomarkers of inflammation collected at hospital admission and collected glucose levels and insulin data throughout hospitalization. The primary outcome was the composite of in-hospital death, need for mechanical ventilation, and need for renal replacement therapy. RESULTS Among participants (mean age 60 years, 58.2\% males), those with DM (n = 686, 33.5\%) had a significantly higher cumulative incidence of the primary outcome (37.8\% vs. 28.6\%) and higher levels of inflammatory biomarkers than those without DM. Among biomarkers, DM was only associated with higher soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) levels in multivariable analysis. Adjusting for suPAR levels abrogated the association between DM and the primary outcome (adjusted odds ratio 1.23 [95\% CI 0.78, 1.37]). In mediation analysis, we estimated the proportion of the effect of DM on the primary outcome mediated by suPAR at 84.2\%. Hyperglycemia and higher insulin doses were independent predictors of the primary outcome, with effect sizes unaffected by adjusting for suPAR levels. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that the association between DM and outcomes in COVID-19 is largely mediated by hyperinflammation as assessed by suPAR levels, while the impact of hyperglycemia is independent of inflammation.},

	abstract = {Accumulating evidence implicates inflammation as a potential pathway in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. The objective of the present study was to assess the ability of C-reactive protein (CRP) to predict the development of diabetes in middle-aged men in the West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study. Baseline plasma samples for CRP measurement were available for 5,245 men of whom 127 were classified as having a transition from normal glucose control to overt diabetes during the study, based on American Diabetes Association criteria. Baseline CRP was an important predictor of the development of diabetes in univariate analysis (hazard ratio [HR] for an increase of 1 SD = 1.55; 95\% CI 1.32--1.82; P {!'} 0.0001). In multivariate analysis, CRP remained a predictor of diabetes development (HR 1.30; 95\% CI 1.07--1.58; P = 0.0075) independent of other clinically employed predictors, including baseline BMI and fasting triglyceride and glucose concentrations. Moreover, there was a graded increase in risk across CRP quintiles throughout the study, evident at even 1 year of follow-up. The highest quintile (CRP ¿4.18 mg/l) was associated with a greater than threefold risk of developing diabetes (HR 3.07; 95\% CI 1.33--7.10) in a multivariate analysis at 5 years. Thus, CRP predicts the development of type 2 diabetes in middle-aged men independently of established risk factors. Because CRP, the most commonly used acute-phase protein in clinical practice, is very stable in serum, our observations have clinical potential in helping to better predict individuals destined to develop type 2 diabetes. They also add to the notion that low-grade inflammation is important in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes.},

During chronic stress, the sympathetic nervous system is hyperactivated, causing physical, psychological, and behavioral abnormalities. At present, there is no accepted standard for stress evaluation. This review aimed to survey studies providing a rationale for selecting heart rate variability (HRV) as a psychological stress indicator. Term searches in the Web of Science{\textregistered}, National Library of Medicine (PubMed), and Google Scholar databases yielded 37 publications meeting our criteria. The inclusion criteria were involvement of human participants, HRV as an objective psychological stress measure, and measured HRV reactivity. In most studies, HRV variables changed in response to stress induced by various methods. The most frequently reported factor associated with variation in HRV variables was low parasympathetic activity, which is characterized by a decrease in the high-frequency band and an increase in the low-frequency band. Neuroimaging studies suggested that HRV may be linked to cortical regions (e.g., the ventromedial prefrontal cortex) that are involved in stressful situation appraisal. In conclusion, the current neurobiological evidence suggests that HRV is impacted by stress and supports its use for the objective assessment of psychological health and stress.},

Circulating cytokines can affect beta cell function directly leading to secretory dysfunction and increased apoptosis. These cytokines can also indirectly affect beta cell function by increasing adipocyte inflammation.The resulting glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity further enhance the inflammatory process resulting in a vicious cycle. Weight reduction and drugs such as metformin have been shown to decrease the levels of C-Reactive Protein by 31\% and 13\%, respectively. Pioglitazone, insulin and statins have anti-inflammatory effects. Interleukin 1 and tumor necrosis factor-α antagonists are in trials and NSAIDs such as salsalate have shown an improvement in insulin sensitivity. Inhibition of 12-lipo-oxygenase, histone de-acetylases, and activation of sirtuin-1 are upcoming molecular targets to reduce inflammation. These therapies have also been shown to decrease the conversion of pre-diabetes state to diabetes. Drugs like glicazide, troglitazone, N-acetylcysteine and selective COX-2 inhibitors have shown benefit in diabetic neuropathy by decreasing inflammatory markers. Retinopathy drugs are used to target vascular endothelial growth factor, angiopoietin-2, various proteinases and chemokines. Drugs targeting the proteinases and various chemokines are pentoxifylline, inhibitors of nuclear factor-kappa B and mammalian target of rapamycin and are in clinical trials for diabetic nephropathy. Commonly used drugs such as insulin, metformin, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, glucagon like peptide-1 agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors also decrease inflammation.

CAN manifests in a spectrum of things, ranging from resting tachycardia and fixed heart rate (HR) to development of ``silent'' myocardial infarction. Clinical correlates or risk markers for CAN are age, DM duration, glycemic control, hypertension, and dyslipidemia (DLP), development of other microvascular complications. Established risk factors for CAN are poor glycemic control in type 1 DM and a combination of hypertension, DLP, obesity, and unsatisfactory glycemic control in type 2 DM. Symptomatic manifestations of CAN include sinus tachycardia, exercise intolerance, orthostatic hypotension (OH), abnormal blood pressure (BP) regulation, dizziness, presyncope and syncope, intraoperative cardiovascular instability, asymptomatic myocardial ischemia and infarction. Methods of CAN assessment in clinical practice include assessment of symptoms and signs, cardiovascular reflex tests based on HR and BP, short-term electrocardiography (ECG), QT interval prolongation, HR variability (24 h, classic 24 h Holter ECG), ambulatory BP monitoring, HR turbulence, baroreflex sensitivity, muscle sympathetic nerve activity, catecholamine assessment and cardiovascular sympathetic tests, heart sympathetic imaging. Although it is common complication, the significance of CAN has not been fully appreciated and there are no unified treatment algorithms for today. Treatment is based on early diagnosis, life style changes, optimization of glycemic control and management of cardiovascular risk factors. Pathogenetic treatment of CAN includes: Balanced diet and physical activity; optimization of glycemic control; treatment of DLP; antioxidants, first of all α-lipoic acid (ALA), aldose reductase inhibitors, acetyl-L-carnitine; vitamins, first of all fat-soluble vitamin B1; correction of vascular endothelial dysfunction; prevention and treatment of thrombosis; in severe cases-treatment of OH. The promising methods include prescription of prostacyclin analogues, thromboxane A2 blockers and drugs that contribute into strengthening and/or normalization of Na+, K+-ATPase (phosphodiesterase inhibitor), ALA, dihomo-γ-linolenic acid (DGLA), ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω-3 PUFAs), and the simultaneous prescription of ALA, ω-3 PUFAs and DGLA, but the future investigations are needed. Development of OH is associated with severe or advanced CAN and prescription of nonpharmacological and pharmacological, in the foreground midodrine and fludrocortisone acetate, treatment methods are necessary.},

	abstract = {Type 1 diabetes is a condition that can lead to serious long-term complications and can have significant psychological and quality of life implications. Its incidence is increasing in all parts of the world, but the reasons for this are incompletely understood. Genetic factors alone cannot explain such a rapid increase in incidence; therefore, environmental factors must be implicated. Lifestyle factors have been classically associated with type 2 diabetes. However, there are data implicating obesity and insulin resistance to type 1 diabetes as well (accelerator hypothesis). Cholesterol has also been shown to be correlated with the incidence of type 1 diabetes; this may be mediated by immunomodulatory effects of cholesterol. There is considerable interest in early life factors, including maternal diet, mode of delivery, infant feeding, childhood diet, microbial exposure (hygiene hypothesis), and use of anti-microbials in early childhood. Distance from the sea has recently been shown to be negatively correlated with the incidence of type 1 diabetes. This may contribute to the increasing incidence of type 1 diabetes since people are increasingly living closer to the sea. Postulated mediating mechanisms include hours of sunshine (and possibly vitamin D levels), mean temperature, dietary habits, and pollution. Ozone, polychlorinated biphenyls, phthalates, trichloroethylene, dioxin, heavy metals, bisphenol, nitrates/nitrites, and mercury are amongst the chemicals which may increase the risk of type 1 diabetes. Another area of research concerns the role of the skin and gut microbiome. The microbiome is affected by many of the factors mentioned above, including the mode of delivery, infant feeding, exposure to microbes, antibiotic use, and dietary habits. Research on the reasons why the incidence of type 1 diabetes is increasing not only sheds light on its pathogenesis but also offers insights into ways we can prevent type 1 diabetes.},

	abstract = {The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) is a landmark multicenter trial designed to test the proposition that the complications of diabetes mellitus are related to elevation of the plasma glucose concentration. The study design was simple. Two groups of patients were followed long term, one treated conventionally (goal: clinical well-being; called the standard treatment group) and another treated intensively (goal: normalization of blood glucose; called the intensive treatment group). The intensive treatment group was clearly distinguished from the standard treatment group in terms of glycated hemoglobin levels and capillary blood glucose values throughout the duration of the study. Normalization of glucose values was not achieved in the intensively treated cohort as a group because mean glucose values were ∼40\% above normal limits. Nonetheless, over the study period, which averaged 7 years, there was an ∼60\% reduction in risk between the intensive treatment group and the standard treatment group in diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy. The benefit of intensive therapy resulted in a delay in the onset and a major slowing of the progression of these three complications. Finally, the benefits of intensive therapy were seen in all categories of subjects regardless of age, sex, or duration of diabetes.},

@article{astrupMarkersEndothelialDysfunction2008,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE---We evaluated the association of biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction and inflammation with all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality and morbidity and decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in type 1 diabetic patients.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS---We prospectively followed 199 type 1 diabetic patients with diabetic nephropathy and 192 patients with persistent normoalbuminuria. Biomarkers were measured at baseline.RESULTS---We constructed two Z scores: the mean inflammatory Z score combined C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule (sICAM-1), and secreted phospholipase A2 and the mean Z score for endothelial dysfunction combined soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and sICAM-1. The mean Z score of inflammatory biomarkers was associated with mortality and the combined end point in patients with diabetic nephropathy after multivariate adjustment (hazard ratio 1.7 [95\% CI 1.1--2.6]; P = 0.025 and 1.5 [1.1--2.2]; P = 0.017). The mean Z score for endothelial dysfunction biomarkers was associated with mortality in a model adjusting for age and sex in patients with diabetic nephropathy (1.6 [1.0--2.3]; P = 0.031). The mean Z score for endothelial dysfunction correlated with decline in GFR (r = −0.243; P = 0.001); the correlation persisted after multivariate adjustment (coefficient −1.38 [95\% CI −2.27 to −0.50]; P = 0.002).CONCLUSIONS---Mean Z scores of inflammatory biomarkers are significantly associated with all-cause mortality and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with nephropathy after multivariate adjustment. These data suggest that the high risk of cardiovascular disease in type 1 diabetes may be explained in part by inflammatory activity. Mean Z score of endothelial dysfunction correlated after multivariate adjustment with the rate of decline in GFR.},

@thesis{awahTreatingDiabetesCameroon2006,
	abstract = {This thesis presents and analyses the findings of research into the management of  diabetes in one urban and one rural district of Cameroon. The phenomenon of noncommunicable  diseases like diabetes mellitus is becoming a recurrent problem in middle  and low-income countries, notably in Sub-Sahara Africa. This ethnographic study, in the  tradition of medical anthropology, involved over two years of fieldwork, and has been  undertaken to shed more light on the paradoxes that underpin the interpretation and  management of diabetes in Cameroon. Initially, I set out to study how diabetes was  managed in clinical settings; but as the research developed my enquiries led out from the  clinic to encompass first the perspectives of patients and their families, and in the end the  perspectives of traditional healers also. It thus draws together four distinct sets of actors  engaged in the process of treating diabetes mellitus: clinical staff, patients, their families,  and traditional healers. In this research, I explored the ways in which Cameroonians  negotiate a meaningful and manageable path between alternative therapeutic regimes.  But as my analysis shows, behind different therapeutic approaches lie alternative  presumptions about aetiology and efficacy, about behaviour and the body.  In integrating the perspectives of the different actors identified above, the research  highlights three major themes. The first concerns the concept of 'compliance', and the  language of frustration voiced by clinic staff about patient reluctance to adhere to  medication and advice. The second concerns 'aetiology' and the ultimately incompatible  styles of reasoning and understanding advanced to explain the causes and consequences  of diabetes, including its complications and its significance as chronic and incurable in a  11  cultural context where the notion of an incurable disease is still seen as unconvincing.  The third concerns ideas of 'power', and the differing ways in which power is attributed  or assumed, ranging from the apparent power of biomedical knowledge and clinic  injunctions, to the assumed power of traditional explanatory frameworks, or the powers  of divination of traditional healers, or the powers of witchcraft or ancestors in inducing  diabetes.  My thesis is unusual (a) in subject matter, (b) in its comparative scope, and (c) in being  done by a Cameroonian ethnographer. While rural Bafut has been the site of several  previous ethnographic studies, almost nothing has been done ethnographically in  Yaounde. This thesis shows that, contrary to my initial working hypothesis, the  similarities in outlook and behaviour between rural and urban settings are more striking  than the differences. The universe of the clinic and biomedicine is not more effective and  accepted in the city, as might have been anticipated, for in both settings traditional  healing beliefs continue to hold a strong influence, creating the problems around  'compliance' mentioned above.},

@article{borgognaAnxietyDepressionGender2019,
	abstract = {Empirical findings indicate that sexual and gender minorities report notably poorer outcomes on measures of mental health when compared with cisgender/heterosexual individuals. Although several studies have examined these issues, few have taken the time to examine differences between cisgender/heterosexual and specific lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer identities. This is especially important as an increasing number of new gender and sexual identities emerge, yet limitations in statistical power often preclude such analyses. Thus, the following study addressed this gap by examining data from a large sample of college students from the national Health Minds Study (n = 43,632). Results indicated that college students with transgender and gender nonconforming identities reported significantly higher rates of depression and anxiety symptoms compared with students with cisgender identities, with large effect sizes. Disparities were also significant across sexual minority participants, with the smallest effect sizes being between heterosexual and gay/lesbian individuals, and the largest effect sizes between heterosexual and pansexual participants for depression, and heterosexual and demisexual participants for anxiety. We also found evidence of an interaction of gender and sexual identity impacting mental health such that those with minority statuses in both identity groups had significantly worse outcomes compared to those with only one minority identity. Our results indicate that individuals in the emerging sexual and gender minority categories (pansexual, demisexual, asexual, queer, questioning, and transgender/gender nonconforming) report significantly higher rates of depression and anxiety when compared with cisgender/heterosexual individuals, and even significantly more than those who identify as gay/lesbian. Implications for mental health providers and researchers are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

@article{boubouchairopoulouBloodPressureVariability2021,
	abstract = {The present study compared the blood pressure variability (BPV) among office (OBP), home (HBP), and ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) measurements and assessed their determinants, as well as their agreement in identifying individuals with high BPV. Individuals attending a hypertension clinic had OBP measurements (2--3 visits) and underwent HBP monitoring (3--7 days, duplicate morning and evening measurements) and ABP monitoring (24\,h, 20-min intervals). BPV was quantified using the standard deviation (SD), coefficient of variation (CV), and variability independent of the mean (VIM) using all BP readings obtained by each method. A total of 626 participants were analyzed (age 52.8\,$\pm$\,12.0 years, 57.7\% males, 33.1\% treated). Systolic BPV was usually higher than diastolic BPV, and out-of-office BPV was higher than office BPV, with ambulatory BPV giving the highest values. BPV was higher in women than men, yet it was not different between untreated and treated individuals. Associations among BPV indices assessed using different measurement methods were weak (r 0.1--0.3) but were stronger between out-of-office BPV indices. The agreement between methods in detecting individuals with high BPV was low (30--40\%) but was higher between out-of-office BPV indices. Older age was an independent determinant of increased OBP variability. Older age, female sex, smoking, and overweight/obesity were determinants of increased out-of-office BPV. These data suggest that BPV differs with different BP measurement methods, reflecting different pathophysiological phenomena, whereas the selection of the BPV index is less important. Office and out-of-office BP measurements appear to be complementary methods in assessing BPV.},

@article{butlerInheritanceDiabetesChinese1967,
	abstract = {1. The pedigrees and Tes-tape scores of over 6000 hamsters in the Best colony in Toronto and the Upjohn Colony in Kalamazoo were examined. It was found that the distribution of Tes-tape scores in the Best colony was 23\%+, 6\%++, 3\%+++, and 5\%++++. The incidence of diabetes rose for the first eleven generations of inbreeding then fell off slightly. In the Upjohn colony, which had a higher incidence of diabetes, the litter sizes were smaller and the pre-weaning deaths greater. When one or both of the parents were diabetic 40\% of the young died as opposed to 14\% for other matings. Non-diabetic parents produced slightly less diabetics and significantly less trace animals than did any other type of mating. --- 2. It was concluded that diabetes is inherited but that no simple system of inheritance will fit the data. A polygenic system is postulated with a minimum of four genes any two of which when homozygus recessive will cause diabetes. Because of the variety of the quadruple recessive and the lower viability of diabetics, the mating diabetic x diabetic will breed true one mating in six. --- 3. The polygenes act on various physiological systems and not on a ``dormant'' diabetic gene. The diabetic syndrome is the result of the action of these genes on enzyme production, cell proliferation, membrane permeability, and general metabolism, in various parts of the body. Thus one would not expect all diabetic hamsters to exhibit retinopathy or hydronephrosis, but one would expect predominantly the same manifestations within the same subline.},

@article{colbergPhysicalActivityDietary2021,
	abstract = {Individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) are able to balance their blood glucose levels while engaging in a wide variety of physical activities and sports. However, insulin use forces them to contend with many daily training and performance challenges involved with fine-tuning medication dosing, physical activity levels, and dietary patterns to optimize their participation and performance. The aim of this study was to ascertain which variables related to the diabetes management of physically active individuals with T1D have the greatest impact on overall blood glucose levels (reported as A1C) in a real-world setting. A total of 220 individuals with T1D completed an online survey to self-report information about their glycemic management, physical activity patterns, carbohydrate and dietary intake, use of diabetes technologies, and other variables that impact diabetes management and health. In analyzing many variables affecting glycemic management, the primary significant finding was that A1C values in lower, recommended ranges ({$<$}7\%) were significantly predicted by a very-low carbohydrate intake dietary pattern, whereas the use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices had the greatest predictive ability when A1C was above recommended (≥7\%). Various aspects of physical activity participation (including type, weekly time, frequency, and intensity) were not significantly associated with A1C for participants in this survey. In conclusion, when individuals with T1D are already physically active, dietary changes and more frequent monitoring of glucose may be most capable of further enhancing glycemic management.},

Materials and materials Data were collected from the National Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2013--2014 (n = 697), cross-sectional national survey adults with Type2 diabetes. Characteristics included retinopathy diagnosis, blood pressure, albumin-creatinine ratio, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), BMI, cholesterol, smoking status, pills/insulin, exercise, age, age at diagnosis, education, sex, race, and marital status. Diabetes preventive behaviors were included. Predictors of GC were assessed using logistic regression. Results The mean age was 61 (SD $\pm$13); the average age at diagnosis 50 (SD $\pm$12.9) and women (51\%). Age ≥60, diabetes length {$>$}10yrs, taking pills/on insulin, albumin-creatinine ratio ≤30mg/g, optimal BP, no retinopathy diagnosis, optimal cholesterol, seeing a doctor for diabetes, doctors checkup ≥2 times and checking HbA1c annually were significant predictors of GC. The association between GC and age (OR=.97, p{$<$}.001; CI: .96-.98) diabetes length {$>$}10yrs (OR=1.55, p{$<$}.05; CI: 1.02-2.34), creatinine-albumin ratio ≤30mg/g (OR=1.97, p{$<$}.001; CI: 1.32-2.94) and checking HbA1c annually (OR=1.86, p{$<$}.01; CI: 1.16-3.00) remained significant after adjustment for the effects of all other statistically significant covariates. Conclusions GC was prevalent among older individuals; suggestive of intervention programs for young adults with diabetes and continuous HbA1c assessment at least annually.},

@article{dibEtiopathogenesisTypeDiabetes2009,
	abstract = {Type 1A diabetes mellitus (T1ADM) is a progressive autoimmune disease mediated by T lymphocytes with destruction of beta cells. Up to now, we do not have precise methods to assess the beta cell mass, "in vivo" or "ex-vivo". The studies about its genetic susceptibility show strong association with class II antigens of the HLA system (particularly DQ). Others genetics associations are weaker and depend on the population studied. A combination of precipitating events may occur at the beginning of the disease. There is a silent loss of immune-mediated beta cells mass which velocity has an inverse relation with the age, but it is influenced by genetic and metabolic factors. We can predict the development of the disease primarily through the determination of four biochemically islet auto antibodies against antigens like insulin, GAD65, IA2 and Znt8. Beta cell destruction is chronically progressive but at clinical diagnosis of the disease a reserve of these cells still functioning. The goal of secondary disease prevention is halt the autoimmune attack on beta cells by redirecting or dampening the immune system. It is remains one of the foremost therapeutic goals in the T1ADM. Glycemic intensive control and immunotherapeutic agents may preserve beta-cell function in newly diagnosed patients with T1ADM. It may be assessed through C-peptide values, which are important for glycemic stability and for the prevention of chronic complications of this disease. This article will summarize the etiopathogenesis mechanisms of this disease and the factors can influence on residual C-peptide and the strategies to it preservation.},

@article{donaInflammationCentralAdiposity2020,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Diabetes and depression are commonly present in the same individuals, suggesting the possibility of underlying shared physiological processes. Inflammation, as assessed with the biomarker C-reactive protein (CRP), has not consistently explained the observed relationship between diabetes and depression, although both are associated with inflammation and share proposed inflammatory mechanisms. Central adiposity has also been associated with both conditions, potentially by causing increased inflammation. This study uses the World Health Organization's Study on global AGEing and adult health (SAGE) Mexico Wave 1 biomarker data (n = 1831) to evaluate if inflammation and central adiposity mediate the relationship between depression and diabetes. METHODS: Depression was estimated using a behavior-based diagnostic algorithm, inflammation using venous dried blood spot (DBS) CRP, central adiposity using waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), and uncontrolled diabetes using venous DBS-glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). RESULTS: The association between depression and uncontrolled diabetes was partially mediated by CRP before but not after WHtR was considered. When WHtR was added to the model, it partially mediated the relationship between diabetes and depression while fully mediating the relationship between depression and CRP. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that central adiposity may be a more significant mediator between diabetes and depression than inflammation and account for the relationship between these disorders and inflammation. Depression may cause an increase in central adiposity, which then may lead to diabetes, but the increase in known systemic inflammatory pathways caused by central adiposity may not be the key pathological mechanism.},

The purpose of this systematic review is to summarize the quantitative findings from the literature focused on the health impact of stigma resulting from discrimination, prejudice, and bias experienced by transgender people.Method: To better understand the current state of the health impact of transgender stigma, the author conducted a search that included stigma, discrimination, prejudice, bias, health, and transgender people.Results: A total of 15 studies met inclusion criteria for review. Results indicate that transgender people experience discrimination, prejudice, and bias at high levels. When internalized, this victimization leads to decreased psychological health, including increased harmful behaviors such as substance abuse and eating disorders, reduced relationship quality, ineffective coping and lower levels of self-esteem, and increased risk of attempted suicide. Internalized stigma also leads to decreased physical health outcomes stemming from healthcare avoidance, reduced healthcare utilization, decreased screenings, and delayed treatment.Discussion: Additional research is needed to enhance generalizability to larger transgender populations. Additional studies are also required to increase provider knowledge and cultural competence to provide safe care environments and transgender-appropriate care. As well, further research is vital to incorporate LGBTQ-sensitive training in healthcare academia.},

@article{duboisBioculturalApproachesTransgender2021,
	abstract = {Transgender and gender diverse (TGD) people are increasingly visible in U.S. communities and in national media. With this increased visibility, access to gender affirming healthcare is also on the rise, particularly for urban youth. Political backlash and entrenchment in a gender binary, however, continue to marginalize TGD people, increasing risk for health disparities. The 2016 National Institute of Health recognition of sexual and gender minority people as a health disparities population increases available funding for much-needed research. In this article, we speak to the need for a biocultural human biology of gender/sex diversity by delineating factors that influence physiological functioning, mental health, and physical health of TGD people. We propose that many of these factors can best be investigated with minimally invasively collected biomarker samples (MICBS) and discuss how to integrate MICBS into research inclusive of TGD people. Research use of MICBS among TGD people remains limited, and wider use could enable essential biological and health data to be collected from a population often excluded from research. We provide a broad overview of terminology and current literature, point to key research questions, and address potential challenges researchers might face when aiming to integrate MCIBS in research inclusive of transgender and gender diverse people. We argue that, when used effectively, MICBS can enhance human biologists' ability to empirically measure physiology and health-related outcomes and enable more accurate identification of pathways linking human experience, embodiment, and health.},

@article{epelStressMayAdd2001,
	abstract = {To date, there are few known predictors of stress-induced eating. The purpose of this study was to identify whether physiological and psychological variables are related to eating after stress. Specifically, we hypothesized that high cortisol reactivity in response to stress may lead to eating after stress, given the relations between cortisol with both psychological stress and mechanisms affecting hunger. To test this, we exposed fifty-nine healthy pre-menopausal women to both a stress session and a control session on different days. High cortisol reactors consumed more calories on the stress day compared to low reactors, but ate similar amounts on the control day. In terms of taste preferences, high reactors ate significantly more sweet food across days. Increases in negative mood in response to the stressors were also significantly related to greater food consumption. These results suggest that psychophysiological response to stress may influence subsequent eating behavior. Over time, these alterations could impact both weight and health.},

	abstract = {It is well known that adipocytes and resident macrophages that have migrated to adipose tissue produce and secrete a variety of biologically active mediators (adipocytokines), which are thought to contribute to the development of insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease (1).The abnormal function of adipocytes may play an important role in the development of a chronic low-grade proinflammatory state associated with obesity (2). For example, adipocyte hypertrophy appears to lead to an imbalance between pro- and anti-inflammatory adipokines. The secretion of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and granulocyte colony--stimulating factor have been positively correlated with adipocyte size.},

@article{festaChronicSubclinicalInflammation2000,
	abstract = {Background---Inflammation has been suggested as a risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis. Recently, some components of the insulin resistance syndrome (IRS) have been related to inflammatory markers. We hypothesized that insulin insensitivity, as directly measured, may be associated with inflammation in nondiabetic subjects. Methods and Results---We studied the relation of C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, and white cell count to components of IRS in the nondiabetic population of the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study (IRAS) (n=1008; age, 40 to 69 years; 33\% with impaired glucose tolerance), a multicenter, population-based study. None of the subjects had clinical coronary artery disease. Insulin sensitivity (SI) was measured by a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test, and CRP was measured by a highly sensitive competitive immunoassay. All 3 inflammatory markers were correlated with several components of the IRS. Strong associations were found between CRP and measures of body fat (body mass index, waist circumference), SI, and fasting insulin and proinsulin (all correlation coefficients {$>$}0.3, P{$<$}0.0001). The associations were consistent among the 3 ethnic groups of the IRAS. There was a linear increase in CRP levels with an increase in the number of metabolic disorders. Body mass index, systolic blood pressure, and SI were related to CRP levels in a multivariate linear regression model. Conclusions---We suggest that chronic subclinical inflammation is part of IRS. CRP, a predictor of cardiovascular events in previous reports, was independently related to SI. These findings suggest potential benefits of anti-inflammatory or insulin-sensitizing treatment strategies in healthy individuals with features of IRS.},

@article{freemanCReactiveProteinIndependent2002,
	abstract = {Accumulating evidence implicates inflammation as a potential pathway in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. The objective of the present study was to assess the ability of C-reactive protein (CRP) to predict the development of diabetes in middle-aged men in the West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study. Baseline plasma samples for CRP measurement were available for 5,245 men of whom 127 were classified as having a transition from normal glucose control to overt diabetes during the study, based on American Diabetes Association criteria. Baseline CRP was an important predictor of the development of diabetes in univariate analysis (hazard ratio [HR] for an increase of 1 SD = 1.55; 95\% CI 1.32--1.82; P \&lt; 0.0001). In multivariate analysis, CRP remained a predictor of diabetes development (HR 1.30; 95\% CI 1.07--1.58; P = 0.0075) independent of other clinically employed predictors, including baseline BMI and fasting triglyceride and glucose concentrations. Moreover, there was a graded increase in risk across CRP quintiles throughout the study, evident at even 1 year of follow-up. The highest quintile (CRP \&gt;4.18 mg/l) was associated with a greater than threefold risk of developing diabetes (HR 3.07; 95\% CI 1.33--7.10) in a multivariate analysis at 5 years. Thus, CRP predicts the development of type 2 diabetes in middle-aged men independently of established risk factors. Because CRP, the most commonly used acute-phase protein in clinical practice, is very stable in serum, our observations have clinical potential in helping to better predict individuals destined to develop type 2 diabetes. They also add to the notion that low-grade inflammation is important in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes.},

	abstract = {SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has claimed millions of lives since its first identification in December 2019. Patients with diabetes are at a high risk of adverse outcomes after COVID-19 infection, whereas infection itself can be associated with severe hyperglycemia, including hyperglycemic emergencies. While the accelerated vaccine development and rollout have considerably decreased morbidity and mortality with reasonable safety, there are emerging reports of worsening of hyperglycemia in response to vaccination, with possible shared pathophysiology with COVID-19 infection-related hyperglycemia. We hereby report two young patients with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) who presented with severe diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) after receiving second doses of COVISHIELD (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) and COVAXIN (BBV152- inactivated whole virion) vaccines. Though a causal link cannot be established, post-vaccination immune response can potentially explain this transient worsening of hyperglycemia and hyperglycemic emergencies. We, hence report diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) following COVID-19 vaccination in T1DM. We suggest that people with diabetes, particularly patients with T1DM with inadequate glycemic control should ideally be closely monitored for hyperglycemia and ketonemia for at least 2 weeks after receiving vaccination for COVID 19.},

The key roles of oxidative stress and inflammation in the progression of vascular complications of this disease are well recognized. Accumulating epidemiologic evidence confirms that physical inactivity is an independent risk factor for insulin resistance and type II diabetes. This paper briefly reviews the pathophysiological pathways associated with oxidative stress and inflammation in diabetes mellitus and then discusses the impact of exercise on these systems. In this regard, we discuss exercise induced activation of cellular antioxidant systems through ``nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor.'' We also discuss anti-inflammatory myokines, which are produced and released by contracting muscle fibers. Antiapoptotic, anti-inflammatory and chaperon effects of exercise-induced heat shock proteins are also reviewed.},

Cancer cells, as well as surrounding stromal and inflammatory cells, engage in well-orchestrated reciprocal interactions to form an inflammatory tumor microenvironment (TME). Cells within the TME are highly plastic, continuously changing their phenotypic and functional characteristics. Here, we review the origins of inflammation in tumors, and the mechanisms whereby inflammation drives tumor initiation, growth, progression, and metastasis. We discuss how tumor-promoting inflammation closely resembles inflammatory processes typically found during development, immunity, maintenance of tissue homeostasis, or tissue repair and illuminate the distinctions between tissue-protective and pro-tumorigenic inflammation, including spatiotemporal considerations. Defining the cornerstone rules of engagement governing molecular and cellular mechanisms of tumor-promoting inflammation will be essential for further development of anti-cancer therapies.},

We evaluated CRP as a possible risk factor of the development of diabetes and metabolic syndrome in a 6-year study of 515 men and 729 women from the Mexico City Diabetes Study.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS---Baseline CRP, indexes of adiposity, and insulin resistance (homeostasis model assessment [HOMA-IR]) were used to predict development of the metabolic syndrome, defined as including two or more of the following: 1) dyslipidemia (triglyceride ≥2.26 mmol/l or HDL cholesterol ≤0.91 mmol/l in men and ≤1.17 mmol/l in women; \&lt;35 and 40 mg/dl for men and women); 2) hypertension (blood pressure \&gt;140/90 mmHg or on hypertensive medication); or 3) diabetes (1999 World Health Organization criteria).RESULTS---At baseline, CRP correlated significantly (P \&lt; 0.001) with all metabolic indexes in women, but less so in men. After 6 years, 14.2\% of men and 16.0\% of women developed the metabolic syndrome. Compared with tertile 1, women with CRP in the highest tertile had an increased relative risk of developing the metabolic syndrome by 4.0 (95\% CI 2.0--7.9) and diabetes by 5.5 (2.2--13.5); these risks changed minimally after adjusting for BMI or HOMA-IR. The area under receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve for the prediction of the development of the syndrome was 0.684 for CRP, increasing to 0.706 when combined with BMI and to 0.710 for a complex model of CRP, BMI, and HOMA-IR.CONCLUSIONS---CRP was not a significant predictor of the development of the metabolic syndrome in men. Our data strongly support the notion that inflammation is important in the pathogenesis of diabetes and metabolic disorders in women.},

	abstract = {Background:\hspace{0.6em} Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is major cardiovascular disease that causes high morbidity and mortality. In AMI, ischemia and necrosis affected some cardiomyocytes leading to a decrease in myocardial contractility which is followed by an acute proinflammation reaction and increased sympathetic tone. Meanwhile, high blood pressure variability (BPV) causing an increased left ventricular workload, heart rate, myocardial oxygen demand and induces proinflamations and endothelial dysfunction. Therefore a high BPV and its associated pathological effects are likely to aggravate the physiological function of the heart and affect the emergence of acute cardiac complications in AMI patients. This study aims to investigate the association's between short-term BPV and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in AMI patients. This retrospective cohort study used simple random sampling to identify AMI patients who were hospitalized at Cipto Mangunkusumo National Hospital between January 2018 and December 2019. Mann Withney was performed to investigate the association between BPV and MACE. Results:\hspace{0.6em} The average systolic BPV value which was calculated as standard deviation (SD) and average real variability (ARV) was higher in the MACE group than in the non-MACE group. Systolic SD and systolic ARV in the MACE group were 13.28\,$\pm$\,5.41 mmHg and 9.88\,$\pm$\,3.81 mmHg respectively. In the non-MACE group, systolic SD and systolic ARV were 10.76 (4.59--26.17) mmHg and 8.65 (3.22--19.35) mmHg respectively. There was no significant association between BPV and MACE. However, there were significant differences between systolic SD and systolic ARV in patients with hypertension who experienced MACE and patients without hypertension who experienced MACE. Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} The BPV of AMI patients who experience MACE was higher than that of non-MACE AMI patients. There was no significant association between BPV a nd MACE during the acute phase of AMI.},

@article{hassounahPrevalenceImpairedAwareness2022,
	abstract = {Background and aims To determine the prevalence of impaired awareness of hypoglycemia (IHA) and self-identification of symptoms in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted on 242 patients with T1D at the Diabetes Treatment Center, Prince Sultan Military Medical City (PSMMC), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia from May 2021 to September 2021. In addition to the demographic data, patients' HbA1c level was also collected. Awareness and symptoms of hypoglycemia were assessed using two validated questionnaire-based methods, namely the Gold and Edinburgh methods. Results The prevalence of IAH among patients with T1D was 62.8\% and the presence of IAH was significantly associated with the duration of T1D (p = 0.019). Compared to males, females had significantly higher (p {$<$} 0.05) levels of warmth, pounding heart, and inability to concentrate. Compared to unmarried, married patients had significantly higher levels of (p {$<$} 0.05) drowsiness, dizziness, and blurred vision. Similarly, compared to school educated, college-educated showed a higher hunger level (p {$<$} 0.05). Patients with HbA1c ≥ 7\% possess a significantly higher level of drowsiness, dizziness, and hunger. Dizziness, warmth, difficulty speaking, pounding heart, and blurred vision were significantly higher among patients with diabetes duration ≥10 yrs. Nausea was significantly higher among smokers than non-smokers (p {$<$} 0.05). Conclusion The prevalence of IAH is high among patients with T1D in Saudi Arabia. Focused and evidence-based interventions are essential to minimize the hypoglycemia risk among patients with T1D.},

The questions examined various aspects of family ecology domains: parents' responses to the child's diagnosis; patterns of adjustment; family support and services used by parents; and parents' feelings and future expectations. Although, it was found that most parents had to make changes in their social life and expressed high levels of frustration and dissatisfaction, many try to maintain their routine life. The majority expressed the need for a strong belief in the child and in the child's future, an optimistic outlook, and a realistic view and acceptance of the disability.

@article{hershnerAssociationsTransgenderIdentity2021,
	abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this study is to examine the associations between transgender identity, sleep, and mental health among a North American cohort of cisgender and transgender college students. Participants and Methods This cross-sectional study surveyed 221,549 North American college students from the 2016--2017 American College Health Association-National College Health Assessment II. Bivariate and multivariable analysis examined associations among transgender identity and outcomes of insomnia symptoms, daytime sleepiness, sleep disorder diagnoses and treatments. Mental health outcomes included mood symptoms, suicidal behaviors, anxiety and depression diagnoses and treatments. Results Transgender identity was reported by 1.6\% (n=3471) of United States (US) and 1.7\% (n=717) Canadian students, respectively. Mean age was 22.5 $\pm$6. Transgender college students have an increased prevalence of daytime sleepiness, insomnia symptoms, diagnoses and/or treatment of insomnia and other sleep disorders as compared to cisgender college students. Mental Health symptoms are more prevalent with a 2-fold increase in depression and anxiety and nearly a 4-fold increase in suicide attempts among transgender students. A higher burden of mood symptoms exists among transgender college students in the US in comparison to Canadian students. Conclusion Transgender college students have an alarmingly high rate of mood, sleep disturbances and sleep diagnoses, and suicidality. Colleges and universities must provide sufficient resources to address the sleep and mental health needs of transgender students. Institutions must adopt gender affirming policies that promote an inclusive environment. Increased allocation of resources and adoption of policies that enhance the physical and mental health of transgender students could improve sleep, mood, and potentially lower the suicide risk among a population that often experiences health inequities.},

	abstract = {Environmental factors play an important role in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes and can determine if a genetically susceptible individual develops the disease. Increasing evidence suggest that among other exogenous agents certain virus infections can contribute to the beta‐cell damaging process. Possible viral etiology of type 1 diabetes has been explored extensively but the final proof for causality is still lacking. Currently, the group of enteroviruses (EVs) is considered as the strongest candidate. These viruses have been found in the pancreas of type 1 diabetic patients, and epidemiological studies have shown more EV infections in diabetic patients than in controls. Prospective studies, such as the Type 1 Diabetes Prediction and Prevention (DIPP) study in Finland, are of fundamental importance in the evaluation viral effects as they can cover all stages of the beta‐cell damaging process, including those preceding the initiation of the process. DIPP study has carried out the most comprehensive virological analyses ever done in prospective cohorts. This article summarizes the findings from these analyses and discuss them in the context of the existing other knowledge and the prospects for intervention studies with EV vaccines or antiviral drugs.},

@article{jamesAdaptiveValueClinical,
	abstract = {In recent years, there has been interest in evaluating the morbidity and mortality risk of circadian, diurnal, or nocturnal blood pressure variation. Variation is a normative property of blood pressure, necessary for survival. Like many physiological functions, blood pressure undergoes  allostasis, meaning that the body does not defend a particular blood pressure value, but rather blood pressure maintains bodily stability through continual change that is initiated by constantly fluctuating internal and external environmental stimuli. Because of its allostatic and adaptive properties, the blood pressure response to unusual situations like a visit to the clinic can lead to misdiagnosis of hypertension. However, blood pressure variation is mostly ignored when evaluating hypertension, which is an arbitrary dichotomy. Whether variation is indicative of pathology should be determined by assessing its appropriateness for the circumstance, which requires quantification of the sources and extent of normative blood pressure responses to everyday living. These responses will vary among populations due to evolutionary genetic differences. The inconsistency of reports regarding aspects of ambulatory blood pressure variation as cardiovascular risk factors likely results from the fact that the measures used do not reflect the actual nature of blood pressure allostasis.},

@article{jamesAllostasisAdaptationBiocultural2020,
	abstract = {Allostasis (literally ``stability through change'') is a key concept for understanding how human behavior and physiological adaptation are related. The continuous variation in arterial blood pressure is an exemplar of allostasis. The purpose of this article is to describe theoretical and methodological developments that have led to an improved biocultural understanding of arterial blood pressure responses to everyday life in humans using allostasis as a paradigm. Arterial pressure variation is directly related to lifestyle, or more specifically, the things that people do, think, and experience in their daily lives. Allostatic patterns of arterial pressure variation also change with life-history events. Patterns are altered as people age and take on differing social roles, and patterns vary between men and women. The cumulative effects of allostasis is the development of allostatic load, or a ``wearing out'' of the system. Studies have linked allostatic load to the development of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). However, the rate and trajectory of allostatic load through adult life is effectively dictated by developmental and evolutionary processes that impact allostasis and will vary among populations as a consequence of developmental, heritable, environmental, and cultural differences. Allostasis is the paradigm for biocultural studies of arterial blood pressure. [allostasis, adaptation, blood pressure, life history, biocultural]},

@article{ji-wonVirusesTypeDiabetes2004,
	abstract = {Type 1 diabetes results from the progressive destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells. Although the etiology of type 1 diabetes is believed to have a major genetic component, studies on the risk of developing type 1 diabetes suggest that environmental factors, such as viruses, may be important etiological determinants. Among the viruses, the most clear and unequivocal evidence that a virus induces type 1 diabetes in animals comes from studies on the D variant of encephalomyocarditis (EMC-D) virus in mice and Kilham rat virus (KRV) in rats. A high titer of EMC-D viral infection results in the development of diabetes within 3 days, primarily due to the rapid destruction of beta cells by viral replication within the cells. A low titer of EMC-D viral infection results in the recruitment of macrophages to the islets. Soluble mediators produced by the activated macrophages such as interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, and nitric oxide play a critical role in the destruction of residual beta cells. KRV causes autoimmune type 1 diabetes in diabetes resistant-BioBreeding rats by breakdown of immune balance, including the preferential activation of effector T cells, such as Th1-like CD45RC + CD4 + T cells and CD8 + T cells, and down-regulation of Th2-like CD45RC - CD4 + and CD4 + CD25 + T cells, rather than by direct infection of pancreatic beta cells.},

@article{jiangSelfefficacyfocusedEducationPersons2019,
	abstract = {The aims of this study were to assess the effectiveness of self-efficacy-focused education on health outcomes in persons with diabetes and review the strategies employed in the interventions. The traditional educational interventions for persons with diabetes were insufficient to achieve the desired outcomes. Self-efficacy-focused education has been used to regulate the blood sugar level, behaviors, and psychosocial indicators for persons with diabetes. This study is a systematic review and meta-analysis. Studies on the effectiveness of self-efficacy-focused education in persons with diabetes were searched in six databases from inception until January 2018. The data were extracted and the quality of literature was assessed independently. Review Manager 5.3 was applied for the meta-analysis. Besides, the findings were summarized for narrative synthesis. Sixteen trials with 1,745 participants were included in the systematic review and ten trails with 1,308 participants in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis for A1C, self-efficacy, self-management behaviors, knowledge, and quality of life (QOL) were represented in four, six, six, three, and three studies, respectively. The findings indicated that self-efficacy-focused education would probably reduce A1C, enhance self-efficacy, regulate self-management behaviors, increase knowledge, and improve the QOL for patients with diabetes. Weak quality studies, limited participants, and heterogeneity hindered the results pooled of the other secondary outcomes of fasting blood glucose, 2-hour plasma glucose, weight, weight circumference, body mass index, plasma lipid profile, and other psychological indicators. Goal setting, self-management skills practicing and recording, peer models, demonstration, persuasion by health providers, and positive feedback were the most commonly used strategies in the interventions. However, physiological/emotion arousal strategies were relatively less applied and varied significantly. Individuals with diabetes may benefit a lot from the self-efficacy-focused education. However, insufficient high-quality studies, short-term follow-up period, relatively deficient physiological/emotion strategies, and incomplete outcome assessments were the drawbacks in most studies. Establishing satisfactory self-efficacy-focused education and better evaluating the effects were required in further studies.},

	abstract = {Diabetes presents significant self-care challenges that require sustained motivation. Motivational Interviewing (MI) has substantial support in enhancing motivation for behavioural change, but its effective application in routine healthcare requires practitioners to acquire and use related skills. The aim of this systematic review was to investigate the impact of MI training on MI-related skills of practitioners who provide diabetes healthcare. PubMed, EMBASE and PsycINFO were searched using the terms motivational interviewing, motivation enhancement, and diabetes. Two assessors independently screened titles, abstracts and full texts for papers reporting the impact of MI training on diabetes healthcare practitioners' outcomes. Of 625 abstracts screened, 22 papers from 17 unique studies were included. All 17 studies reported some improvement in MI skills, with 14 finding improvements in more than 50\% and three less than 35\%. However, the risk of bias and outcome measures varied widely between studies. All studies showed diabetes healthcare practitioners acquired and applied MI skills post-training, to varying levels. Findings suggest training should include education, role play, and ongoing supervision to maintain skills.},

@article{karwaySelfManagementBehaviorsPatients2020,
	abstract = {Objectives This article aims to evaluate adult type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) self-management behaviors (SMBs) related to exercise and alcohol on a survey versus a smartphone app to compare self-reported and self-tracked SMBs, and examine inter- and intrapatient variability. Methods Adults with T1DM on insulin pump therapy were surveyed about their alcohol, meal, and exercise SMBs. For 4 weeks, participants self-tracked their alcohol, meal, and exercise events, and their SMBs corresponding with these events via an investigator-developed app. Descriptive statistics and generalized linear mixed-effect models were used to analyze the data Results Thirty-five participants self-tracked over 5,000 interactions using the app. Variability in how participants perceived the effects of exercise and alcohol on their blood glucose was observed. The congruity between SMBs self-reported on the survey and those self-tracked with the app was measured as mean (SD). The lowest congruity was for alcohol and exercise with 61.9\% (22.7) and 66.4\% (20.2), respectively. Congruity was higher for meals with 80.9\% (21.0). There was significant daily intra- and interpatient variability in SMBs related to preprandial bolusing: recommended bolus, p {$<$} 0.05; own bolus choice, p {$<$} 0.01; and recommended basal adjustment, p {$<$} 0.01. Conclusion This study highlights the variability in intra- and interpatient SMBs obtained through the use of a survey and app. The outcomes of this study indicate that clinicians could use both one-time and every-day assessment tools to assess SMBs related to meals. For alcohol and exercise, further research is needed to understand the best assessment method for SMBs. Given this degree of patient variability, there is a need for an educational intervention that goes beyond the traditional ``one-size-fits-all'' approach of diabetes management to target individualized treatment barriers.},

Retrospective cohort of admitted pandemic DKA/COVID-19+ patients comparing prevalence/outcomes to pre-pandemic DKA patients that takes place in Eleven hospitals of New York City Health \& Hospitals. Our included participants during the pandemic period were admitted COVID-19+ patients ({$>$}18 years) and during the pre-pandemic period were admissions ({$>$}18 years) selected through the medical record. We excluded transfers during both periods. The intervention was COVID-19+ by PCR testing. The main outcome measured was mortality during the index hospitalization and secondary outcomes were demographics, medical histories and triage vital signs, and laboratory tests. Definition of DKA: Beta-Hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) ({$>$}0.4 mmol/L) and bicarbonate ({$<$}15 mmol/L) or pH ({$<$}7.3). Demographics and past medical histories were similar during the pre-pandemic (n = 6938) vs. pandemic (n = 7962) periods. DKA prevalence was greater during pandemic (3.14\%, 2.66--3.68) vs. pre-pandemic period (0.72\%, 0.54--0.95) (p {$>$} 0.001). DKA/COVID-19+ mortality rates were greater (46.3\% (38.4--54.3) vs. pre-pandemic period (18\%, 8.6--31.4) (p {$<$} 0.001).

COVID-19 increased the prevalence of DKA with higher mortality rates secondary to COVID-19 severity, not DKA. We suggest DKA screening all COVID-19+ patients and prioritizing ICU DKA/COVID-19+ with low oxygen saturation, blood pressures, or renal insufficiency.},

@article{khubchandaniCOVID19PandemicWeight2022,
	abstract = {Background The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the lives of people in many ways. However, little is known about weight gain in American adults during the pandemic. Aims and methods The purpose of this study was to conduct a national assessment of weight gain in adult Americans after the first year of the pandemic. An online questionnaire was employed to explore perceptions of adults regarding pandemic weight gain and the relationship between weight gain and sociodemographic characteristics, pre-pandemic weight status, and psychological distress. Multiple methods were used to assess the psychometric properties of the questionnaire (i.e., face validity, content validity, and internal consistency reliability testing). Chi-Square tests and logistic regression analysis were used to assess group differences and predictors of weight gain in the study participants. Results A total of 3473 individuals participated in the study with weight changes distributed as: gained weight (48\%), remained the same weight (34\%), or lost weight (18\%). Those who reported being very overweight before the pandemic were most likely to gain weight (65\%) versus those who reported being slightly overweight (58\%) or normal weight before the pandemic (40\%). Weight gain was statistically significantly higher in those with anxiety (53\%), depression (52\%), or symptoms of both (52\%). The final multiple regression model found that the statistically significant predictors of pandemic weight gain were psychological distress, pre-pandemic weight status, having children at home; and time since last bodyweight check. Conclusions Population health promotion strategies in the pandemic should emphasize stress reduction to help individuals manage body weight and avoid chronic diseases in the future.},

@article{kimStressHeartRate2018,
	abstract = {Objective Physical or mental imbalance caused by harmful stimuli can induce stress to maintain homeostasis. During chronic stress, the sympathetic nervous system is hyperactivated, causing physical, psychological, and behavioral abnormalities. At present, there is no accepted standard for stress evaluation. This review aimed to survey studies providing a rationale for selecting heart rate variability (HRV) as a psychological stress indicator. Methods Term searches in the Web of Science{\textregistered}, National Library of Medicine (PubMed), and Google Scholar databases yielded 37 publications meeting our criteria. The inclusion criteria were involvement of human participants, HRV as an objective psychological stress measure, and measured HRV reactivity. Results In most studies, HRV variables changed in response to stress induced by various methods. The most frequently reported factor associated with variation in HRV variables was low parasympathetic activity, which is characterized by a decrease in the high-frequency band and an increase in the low-frequency band. Neuroimaging studies suggested that HRV may be linked to cortical regions (e.g., the ventromedial prefrontal cortex) that are involved in stressful situation appraisal. Conclusion In conclusion, the current neurobiological evidence suggests that HRV is impacted by stress and supports its use for the objective assessment of psychological health and stress.},

	abstract = {Diabetes mellitus (type 1 and type 2) and its various complications continue to place a huge burden on global medical resources, despite the availability of numerous drugs that successfully lower blood glucose levels. The major challenging issue in diabetes management is the prevention of various complications that remain the leading cause of diabetes-related mortality. Moreover, the limited long-term durability of monotherapy and undesirable side effects of currently used anti-diabetic drugs underlie the urgent need for novel therapeutic approaches. Phytochemicals represent a rich source of plant-derived molecules that are of pivotal importance to the identification of compounds with therapeutic potential. In this review, we aim to discuss recent advances in the identification of a large array of phytochemicals with immense potential in the management of diabetes and its complications. Given that metabolic inflammation has been established as a key pathophysiological event that drives the progression of diabetes, we focus on the protective effects of representative phytochemicals in metabolic inflammation. This paper also discusses the potential of phytochemicals in the development of new drugs that target the inflammation in the management of diabetes and its complications.},

	abstract = {The levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were determined by serial measurements after four types of uncomplicated elective orthopedic surgery. The type of operations chosen for this study were total hip arthroplasty (primary, n = 109; and revisions caused by aseptic loosening, n = 9), unicondylar knee arthroplasty (n = 39), and lumbar microdiskectomy (n = 36). In all patients, CRP levels increased after surgery, reaching peak levels on the third day after hip arthroplasties (primary, 116 +/- 43 mg/l; revisions, 136 +/- 58 mg/l) and on the second day after knee arthroplasties (140 +/- 46 mg/l) and lumbar microdiskectomy (48 +/- 27 mg/l). C-reactive protein levels usually dropped to normal (less than 10 mg/l) within 21 days after surgery. No correlations were found between CRP response and the type of anesthesia, amount of bleeding, transfusion, operation time, administered drugs, age, or gender. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate increased to peak levels about five days after surgery, followed by a slow and irregular decrease. Still, 42 days after uncomplicated operations ESR often remained elevated. In conclusion, the level of CRP must be considered a better diagnostic aid for the early detection of postoperative infections than ESR. It can be assumed that the rapid decline in CRP after uncomplicated orthopedic surgery will be interrupted by a second rise or by a persisting elevated level if infectious complications occur.},

@article{liuSleepModeratesAssociation2021,
	abstract = {Background: Arterial stiffness and increased blood pressure variability (BPV) are important subclinical cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Evidence is accumulating that poor sleep is associated with subclinical CVDs. The purpose of our study was to investigate how sleep was related to arterial stiffness and BPV. We also explored whether sleep moderated the association between arterial stiffness and BPV. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study including 78 healthy adults aged between 35 and 64 years. Variables of interest were: 1) objective seep characteristics, assessed with a wrist actigraphy for two consecutive nights; 2) arterial stiffness, measured by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV); and 3) BPV, measured using an ambulatory blood pressure monitor over 24 h and estimated by average real variability. Results: Lower sleep efficiency was an independent predictor of higher cfPWV and higher systolic BPV, while longer wake after sleep onset (WASO) was an independent predictor of higher cfPWV only. In addition, cfPWV showed a positive relationship with systolic BPV, and this relationship was moderated by sleep efficiency and WASO, respectively. The relationship between cfPWV and systolic BPV became stronger among individuals who had a level of sleep efficiency lower than 84\% and who had WASO higher than 67 min, respectively. Conclusion: Our study showed that poor sleep not only directly linked with arterial stiffness and BPV but also moderated the relationship between these two subclinical CVDs. These findings suggest that improving sleep quality could be a target intervention to promote cardiovascular health in clinical practice. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

METHODS Using a health information model to guide our research, we conducted 9 focus groups with 46 adults with a diagnosis of diabetes and then analyzed the transcripts and notes from these focus groups. RESULTS Five themes emerged: (1) passive receipt of health information about diabetes is an important aspect of health information behavior; (2) patients weave their own information web depending on their disease trajectory; (3) patients' personal relationships help them understand and use this information; (4) a relationship with a health care professional is needed to cope with complicated and sometimes conflicting information; and (5) health literacy makes a difference in patients' ability to understand and use information. CONCLUSIONS Patients make decisions about diabetes self-management depending on their current needs, seeking and incorporating diverse information sources not traditionally viewed as providing health information. Based on our findings, we have developed a new health information model that reflects both the nonlinear nature of health information-seeking behavior and the interplay of both active information seeking and passive receipt of information.},

Interestingly, it appears that the beta cell pioneered the formation or the foundation of the pancreatic organ according to current phylogenetic insights. Such phylogenetic aspects of a pancreatic stem cell are at the end discussed in relation to directed differentiation of ES-cells towards therapeutic beta-cells.},

Reconstitution of a functional beta-cell mass by cell therapy--using organ donor islets of Langerhans--has been demonstrated to restore euglycaemia in the absence of insulin treatment. This remarkable achievement has stimulated the search for appropriate stem cell sources from which adequate expansion and maturation of therapeutic beta cells can be achieved. This recent activity is reviewed and presented with particular focus on directed differentiation from pluripotent embryonic stem cells (versus other stem/progenitor cell sources) based on knowledge from pancreatic beta-cell development and the parallel approach to controlling endogenous beta-cell neogenesis.},

	abstract = {Clinical evidence exists that patients with diabetes are at higher risk for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We investigated the physiological origins of this clinical observation linking diabetes with severity and adverse outcome of COVID-19. Publication mining was applied to reveal common physiological contexts in which diabetes and COVID-19 have been investigated simultaneously. Overall, we have acquired 1,121,078 publications from PubMed in the time span between 01-01-2000 and 17-04-2020, and extracted knowledge graphs interconnecting the topics related to diabetes and COVID-19. The Data Mining revealed three pathophysiological pathways linking diabetes and COVID-19. The first pathway indicates a higher risk for COVID-19 because of a dysregulation of Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. The other two important physiological links between diabetes and COVID-19 are liver dysfunction and chronic systemic inflammation. A deep network analysis has suggested clinical biomarkers predicting the higher risk: Hypertension, elevated serum Alanine aminotransferase, high Interleukin-6, and low Lymphocytes count. The revealed biomarkers can be applied directly in clinical practice. For newly infected patients, the medical history needs to be checked for evidence of a long-term, chronic dysregulation of these biomarkers. In particular, patients with diabetes, but also those with prediabetic state, deserve special attention.},

Methods An observational study was conducted at the outpatient consulting service in a specialized hospital in Santo Domingo, DR. We used a non-probabilistic, convenience sampling strategy, and the World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL-BREF) short form questionnaire was applied. Results The patients presented lower impact in QoL domains was: pain ( x ¯ = 29.07, SD = 3.04) and negative feelings ( x ¯ = 28.70, SD = 3.33). We found there is a negative correlation between the psychological domains and the fasting glycemia (r ho = −0.192, p {$<$} 0.05), also between the of all domains of QoL and metabolic control, HbA1C (r ho = −0.205, p {$<$} 0.05), and fasting glycaemia (r ho = −0.214, p {$<$} 0.05). There was a significant difference in the physical domains F (1, 131) = 9.73, p = 0.002, η2 = 0.069, indicating that men (M = 14.81) have a higher physical QoL than women (M = 13.72). Conclusion Given the evidence of the impact of metabolic control and the different domains to QoL, it is necessary to consider these aspects in the treatment plan of patients with diabetes, to ensure adequate management and control of future complications.},

	abstract = {Although an association between high blood pressure and cognitive decline has been reported, no studies have investigated the association between home blood pressure and cognitive decline. Home blood pressure measurements can also provide day-to-day blood pressure variability calculated as the within-participant SD. The objectives of this prospective study were to clarify whether home blood pressure has a stronger predictive power for cognitive decline than conventional blood pressure and to compare the predictive power of the averaged home blood pressure with day-to-day home blood pressure variability for cognitive decline. Of 485 participants (mean age, 63 years) who did not have cognitive decline (defined as Mini-Mental State Examination score, {$<$}24) initially, 46 developed cognitive decline after a median follow-up of 7.8 years. Each 1-SD increase in the home systolic blood pressure value showed a significant association with cognitive decline (odds ratio, 1.48; P=0.03). However, conventional systolic blood pressure was not significantly associated with cognitive decline (odds ratio, 1.24; P=0.2). The day-to-day variability in systolic blood pressure was significantly associated with cognitive decline after including home systolic blood pressure in the same model (odds ratio, 1.51; P=0.02), whereas the odds ratio of home systolic blood pressure remained positive, but it was not significant. Home blood pressure measurements can be useful for predicting future cognitive decline because they can provide information not only on blood pressure values but also on day-to-day blood pressure variability.},

This article uses the example of depression and Type 2 diabetes comorbidity to illustrate how attending to the social determinants of mental and physical health beyond the reproductive years contributes to a more holistic agenda for women's health. For instance, we must address the plurality of experiences that shape women's health from social determinants of depression, such as gendered subjugation within the home and public sphere, to the structural determinants of obesity and diabetes, such as poor access to healthy foods and health care. Attending to the complexities of health and social well-being beyond the reproductive years helps the women's global health agenda capture the full spectrum of health concerns, particularly the chronic and non-communicable conditions that emerge as life expectancy increases.},

Amongst many symptoms like myalgia, headache, cough, breathlessness; fatigue is is most prevalent and makes the patient severely debilitated. Research on PCS, in particular fatigue, in patients with diabetes has not been done. In this prospective study, we included patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) who had COVID-19 (mild to moderate severity), and matched T2D patients who did not suffer from COVID-19. Demography, anthropometry, glycemic measures, treatment, and details of COVID-19 were recorded. Symptoms were scored using Chalder Fatigue Scale (reported as fatigue score, FS) and handgrip strength (in kg) was recorded by Jamar Hydraulic Hand Dynamometer. A total of 108 patients were included (cases, 52, controls, 56). Both groups were matched for age, duration of diabetes, BMI, TSH, serum albumin and vitamin D levels. T2D patients who had COVID-19 showed significantly more fatigue when compared with patients who did not have COVID-19 but both groups had comparable handgrip strength. Furthermore, patients with T2D with previous COVID-19 infection and who had FS {$>$} 4 have had significant higher inflammation markers during acute illness, and post COVID-19, had increased post prandial blood glucose levels, lost more weight, had reduced physical activity and showed significantly lower handgrip strength as compared to those with FS {$<$} 4. Patients with T2D who had COVID-19 infection as compared to those without had significantly more fatigue after the acute illness, and those with higher FS had reduced handgrip strength indicating sarcopenia, even after careful matching for common contributory factors to fatigue at baseline. Rehabilitation of those with FS{$>$}4 after acute infection would require careful attention to nutrition, glycemic control and graduated physical activity protocol.},

	abstract = {Background /Aim: Various reports of the occurrence of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) in patients with COVID-19 have been published, denoting an association between both diseases. Therefore, we conducted this systematic review to summarize the prevalence of T1DM in COVID-19 patients and to identify the clinical presentations and outcomes in this patient population. Materials and methods Up to 10/27/2020, Medline, Embase, cochrane and google scholar databases were searched for original studies investigating the association between COVID-19 and T1DM. A manual search was conducted to identify missing studies. The quality of included studies was analyzed by the National Institute of Health (NIH) risk of bias tool. Outcomes included length of hospital stay, hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), severe hypoglycemia, and death. Results Fifteen studies were included in the qualitative analysis. Included studies reported data of both adult and pediatric patients. The prevalence of T1DM in COVID-19 patients ranged from 0.15\% to 28.98\%, while the rate of COVID-19 in patients with T1DM ranged from 0\% to 16.67\%. Dry cough, nausea, vomiting, fever and elevated blood glucose levels were the most commonly reported presentations. The investigated outcomes varied widely among studied populations. Conclusions The prevalence of T1DM in patients with COVID-19 ranged from 0.15\% to 28.98\%. The most common presentation of COVID-19 in patients with T1DM included fever, dry cough, nausea and vomiting, elevated blood glucose and diabetic ketoacidosis. The outcomes of COVID-19 in terms of length of hospital stay, hospitalization, ICU admission, DKA rate, and severe hypoglycemia were reported variably in included studies. Due to the heterogeneous study populations and the presence of many limitations, more studies are still warranted to reach a definitive conclusion.},

The purpose of this study is to estimate the prevalence of depression in Iranian patients with diabetes. The search was conducted in the databases of Scientific Information Database (SID), MagIran, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. The following keywords and their possible combinations were used: depressive disorder, major depressive disorder, dysthymic disorder, diabetes mellitus and Iran. Heterogeneity between studies was examined with I2. The data were analyzed using the meta-analysis method and random-effects model with Stata version 11.0. The analysis of 37 selected articles with a total sample size of 7849 indicated that the overall prevalence of depression in Iranian patients with diabetes was 54\% (95\% CI: 47.32--60.70). In addition, the prevalence of depression in women (56.25\%; 95\% CI: 48.83--63.68) was higher than that of men (41.05\%; 95\% CI: 32.74--49.36). The results showed that there was no relationship between the prevalence of depression and publication year (0.249), sample size (p = 0.529), and mean age of the subjects (p = 0.330). More than half of the patients with diabetes suffer from depression. Identification and treatment of these patients can be an important step in controlling and delaying the diabetes complication.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE Glucose response curves (GRCs) during oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) are predictive of type 1 diabetes. We performed a longitudinal analysis in pancreatic autoantibody-positive individuals to assess 1) characteristic GRC changes during progression to type 1 diabetes and 2) GRC changes in relation to b-cell function changes and to combined glucose and C-peptide response curve (GCRC) changes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Among antibody-positive individuals with serial OGTTs in the TrialNet Pathway to Prevention study, GRC changes from first to last OGTTs were compared between progressors (n 5 298) to type 1 diabetes and nonprogressors (n 5 2,216). GRC changes from last OGTT before diagnosis to diagnostic OGTTs were studied in progressors. RESULTS GRCs changed more frequently from biphasic (two peaks) to monophasic (one peak) GRCs between first and last OGTTs in progressors than in nonprogressors (75.4\% vs. 51.0\%, respectively; P {$<$} 0.001). In contrast, GRCs of progressors changed less frequently from monophasic to biphasic than those of nonprogressors (12.6\% vs. 30.6\%; P {$<$} 0.001). Monotonic (continuous increase) GRCs were present in 47.7\% of progressors at diagnosis. The early (30--0 min) C-peptide response decreased in progressors with GRCs changing from biphasic to monophasic between first and last OGTTs (P {$<$} 0.001) and from monophasic to monotonic between last and diagnostic OGTTs (P {$<$} 0.001). Conversely, the early C-peptide response increased among nonprogressors with GRCs changing from monophasic to biphasic (P {$<$} 0.001). Changes in GRCs were related to changes in GCRCs. CONCLUSIONS Characteristic GRC changes, biphasic to monophasic to monotonic, occur during the progression to type 1 diabetes. These GRC changes correspond to decreasing b-cell function.},

@article{pickupNIDDMDiseaseInnate1997,
	abstract = {Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) is commonly associated with hypertrigly-ceridaemia, low serum HDL-cholesterol concentrations, hypertension, obesity and accelerated atherosclerosis (metabolic syndrome X). Since a similar dyslipidaemia occurs with the acute-phase response, we investigated whether elevated acute-phase/stress reactants (the innate immune system's response to environmental stress) and their major cytokine mediator (interleukin-6, IL-6) are associated with NIDDM and syndrome X, and may thus provide a unifying pathophysiological mechanism for these conditions. Two groups of Caucasian subjects with NIDDM were studied. Those with any 4 or 5 features of syndrome X (n = 19) were compared with a group with 0 or 1 feature of syndrome X (n = 25) but similar age, sex distribution, diabetes duration, glycaemic control and diabetes treatment. Healthy non-diabetic subjects of comparable age and sex acted as controls. Overnight urinary albumin excretion rate, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, was also assayed in subjects to assess its relationship to the acute-phase response. Serum sialic acid was confirmed as a marker of the acute-phase response since serum concentrations were significantly related to established acute-phase proteins such as α-1 acid glycoprotein (r = 0.82, p {$<$} 0.0001). There was a significant graded increase of serum sialic acid, α-1 acid glycoprotein, IL-6 and urinary albumin excretion rate amongst the three groups, with the lowest levels in non-diabetic subjects, intermediate levels in NIDDM patients without syndrome X and highest levels in NIDDM patients with syndrome X. C-reactive protein and cortisol levels were also higher in syndrome X-positive compared to -negative patients and serum amyloid A was higher in both diabetic groups than in the control group. We conclude that NIDDM is associated with an elevated acute-phase response, particularly in those with features of syndrome X. Abnormalities of the innate immune system may be a contributor to the hypertriglyceridaemia, low HDL cholesterol, hypertension, glucose intolerance, insulin resistance and accelerated atherosclerosis of NIDDM. Microalbuminuria may be a component of the acutephase response.},

According to previous studies, hyperglycemia could be an independent predictor of mortality. The objective of the study is to assess the risk of mortality in non-diabetic patients with hyperglycemia during hospitalization. Methods In this systematic review, we conducted literature reviews on several databases. Twelve studies were retrieved and critically reviewed using NOS. Results A majority of the studies reported that hospital related hyperglycemia increased the mortality rate. Conclusions Hospital related hyperglycemia is an independent predictor factor for both in-hospital and long-term mortality.},

@article{priyaReviewInsulinResistance2018,
	abstract = {There is a rising trend of overweight and obesity among individuals with type 1 diabetes. This is often associated with insulin resistance, increased insulin dose requirements and poor glycemic control. Insulin resistance is also seen during puberty and is strongly related to increased risk of cardiovascular disease. The role of metformin as an adjunct to ongoing intensive insulin therapy in type 1 diabetics has been evaluated in several randomized trials, including the recently concluded T1D Exchange Network trial in adolescents and the REMOVAL trial in adults. Metformin reduces the insulin dose requirement, insulin-induced weight gain, and total and LDL cholesterol, but results in an increased risk of gastrointestinal adverse effects and a minor increase in the risk of hypoglycemia. In addition, metformin has been shown to reduce maximal carotid intima media thickness and therefore may extend cardioprotective benefits in type 1 diabetes. The role of metformin as adjunctive therapy in type 1 diabetes needs to be explored further in outcome trials.},

	abstract = {Research has generally shown the benefits of social support, such as the buffering effects on life stressors, yet there has been little empirical investigation of different types of support resources for transgender individuals. We examined family support, support from friends, and connectedness to a transgender community and how these forms of support come together to influence mental health and resilience. The sample included 695 transgender participants (mean age = 25.52 years, SD = 9.68, range = 16--73; 75.7\% White) who completed an online survey. Greater than half of participants reported moderate to severe levels of anxious and depressive symptoms. Family social support had the strongest correlations with symptoms of anxiety and depression (r = −.31 and −.37, respectively, p n = 323; 47.1\%) had high levels of support from family and friends and high levels of community connectedness. This class had lower levels of depression and anxiety symptoms and higher levels of resilience compared to other classes (Class 2, n = 276, 40.3\%, high friend/community, low family; Class 3, n = 47, 6.9\%, low support; Class 4, n = 39, 5.7\%, high family, low friend/community). This study highlights the importance of examining support from a more holistic approach and provides insight into unique associations between familial social support and resilience.

@article{ridkerCReactiveProteinMetabolic2003,
	abstract = {Background--- The metabolic syndrome describes a high-risk population having 3 or more of the following clinical characteristics: upper-body obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL, hypertension, and abnormal glucose. All of these attributes, however, are associated with increased levels of C-reactive protein (CRP). Methods and Results--- We evaluated interrelationships between CRP, the metabolic syndrome, and incident cardiovascular events among 14 719 apparently healthy women who were followed up for an 8-year period for myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization, or cardiovascular death; 24\% of the cohort had the metabolic syndrome at study entry. At baseline, median CRP levels for those with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 characteristics of the metabolic syndrome were 0.68, 1.09, 1.93, 3.01, 3.88, and 5.75 mg/L, respectively (Ptrend {$<$}0.0001). Over the 8-year follow-up, cardiovascular event-free survival rates based on CRP levels above or below 3.0 mg/L were similar to survival rates based on having 3 or more characteristics of the metabolic syndrome. At all levels of severity of the metabolic syndrome, however, CRP added prognostic information on subsequent risk. For example, among those with the metabolic syndrome at study entry, age-adjusted incidence rates of future cardiovascular events were 3.4 and 5.9 per 1000 person-years of exposure for those with baseline CRP levels less than or greater than 3.0 mg/L, respectively. Additive effects for CRP were also observed for those with 4 or 5 characteristics of the metabolic syndrome. The use of different definitions of the metabolic syndrome had minimal impact on these findings. Conclusions--- These prospective data suggest that measurement of CRP adds clinically important prognostic information to the metabolic syndrome.},

	abstract = {Introduction Our aim was to assess the association between casual blood glucose level and subsequent cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality among community-dwelling adults without a diagnosis of diabetes. Research design and methods In this community-based cohort study, 159 731 individuals with a measurement of casual blood glucose were followed from their participation date in Cohort of Norway (CONOR) (1994--2003) until a CVD episode, death or 31 December 2009. All analyses were done using Cox proportional hazard regression, and the results are reported as multivariable-adjusted HRs with 95\% CI. Results Compared with those with normal glucose levels ({$<$}7.8 mmol/L), participants categorized as having borderline (7.8--11.0 mmol/L) levels showed an increased risk of a stroke (HR 1.29; 95\% CI 1.12 to 2.49) and cardiovascular (HR 1.29; 95\% CI 1.12 to 2.48), and all-cause (HR 1.27; 95\% CI 1.16 to 1.38) mortality, while participants with high glucose levels ({$>$}11.0 mmol/L) had an even more increased risk. One mmol/L increase in glucose level was associated with an increased risk of all four endpoints among participants with borderline as well as within normal glucose levels. In analyses stratified by sex and age group, the CVD risk estimates tended to be higher in women than in men and in those {$<$}65 years of age but no significant interactions were found. Conclusion An increase in casual blood glucose levels, even within the range of normal and borderline levels, was positively associated with increased risk of CVD and mortality among community-dwelling adults without a known diagnosis of diabetes.},

This chronic inflammatory state contributes to long-term complications of diabetes, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), retinopathy, cardiovascular disease, and nephropathy, and may underlie the association of type 2 diabetes with other conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, polycystic ovarian syndrome, gout, and rheumatoid arthritis. Here, we review the current understanding of the mechanisms underlying inflammation in obesity, T2D, and related disorders. We discuss how chronic tissue inflammation results in IR, impaired insulin secretion, glucose intolerance, and T2D and review the effect of inflammation on diabetic complications and on the relationship between T2D and other pathologies. In this context, we discuss current therapeutic options for the treatment of metabolic disease, advances in the clinic and the potential of immune-modulatory approaches.},

@article{saeediGlobalRegionalDiabetes2019,
	abstract = {AIMS: To provide global estimates of diabetes prevalence for 2019 and projections for 2030 and 2045. METHODS: A total of 255 high-quality data sources, published between 1990 and 2018 and representing 138 countries were identified. For countries without high quality in-country data, estimates were extrapolated from similar countries matched by economy, ethnicity, geography and language. Logistic regression was used to generate smoothed age-specific diabetes prevalence estimates (including previously undiagnosed diabetes) in adults aged 20-79\,years. RESULTS: The global diabetes prevalence in 2019 is estimated to be 9.3\% (463 million people), rising to 10.2\% (578 million) by 2030 and 10.9\% (700 million) by 2045. The prevalence is higher in urban (10.8\%) than rural (7.2\%) areas, and in high-income (10.4\%) than low-income countries (4.0\%). One in two (50.1\%) people living with diabetes do not know that they have diabetes. The global prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance is estimated to be 7.5\% (374 million) in 2019 and projected to reach 8.0\% (454 million) by 2030 and 8.6\% (548 million) by 2045. CONCLUSIONS: Just under half a billion people are living with diabetes worldwide and the number is projected to increase by 25\% in 2030 and 51\% in 2045.},

Since markers of inflammation predict coronary heart disease and are raised in patients with type 2 diabetes, we investigated whether they predict whether people will develop type 2 diabetes. Methods 12\hphantom{,}330 men and women, aged 45--64 years, were followed up for a mean of 7 years. We analysed the association between different markers of acute inflammation and subsequent diagnosis of diabetes. In a subgroup of 610 individuals selected originally for an unrelated atherosclerosis case-control study, we also investigated diabetes associations with total sialic acid and orosomucoid, haptoglobin, and α1-antitrypsin. Findings 1335 individuals had a new diagnosis of diabetes. Adjusted odds ratios for developing diabetes for quartile extremes were 1·9 (95\% CI 1·6--2·3) for raised white-cell count, 1·3 (1·0--1·5) for low serum albumin, and 1·2 (1·0--1·5) for raised fibrinogen. In the subgroup analysis, individuals with concentrations of orosomucoid and sialic acid of more than the median had odds ratios of 7·9 (2·6--23·7) and 3·7 (1·4--9·8), respectively. Adjustment for body-mass index and waist-to-hip ratio lessened the associations; those for white-cell count (1·5 [1·3--1·8]), orosomucoid (7·1 [2·1--23·7]), and sialic acid (2·8 [1·0--8·1]) remained significant. Interpretation Markers of inflammation are associated with the development of diabetes in middle-aged adults. Although autoimmunity may partly explain these associations, they probably reflect the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes.},

@article{sprietsmaDiabetesCanBe1994,
	abstract = {Hypersecretion of insulin increases the chance of the incidence of diabetes type I and II, while inhibiting insulin secretion helps prevent diabetes. Trace elements like zinc and vanadium prevent hyperinsulinemia, partly because of their own insulin activity, which is also a property of interleukin-1 (IL-1), particularly during periods of illness and stress. Like vanadium, IL-1 can replace insulin for many hours and regulate glucose metabolism. Vanadium, zinc and IL-1 ensure that insulin-producing β-cells in the pancreas do not lose too much zinc, which leaves the β-cells together with insulin. Zinc forms a complex with metallothionein in β-cells that provides protection against free (oxygen) radicals, which become active during immune responses triggered by bacteria and viruses, for instance. In addition, zinc is the only non-toxic trace element in the body that regulates concentration-dependent immune responses on many levels. Avoiding deficiencies of trace elements will enable the reduction of the incidence of diabetes.},

@article{sprostonRoleCReactiveProtein2018,
	abstract = {C-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute inflammatory protein that increases up to 1,000-fold at sites of infection or inflammation. CRP is produced as a homopentameric protein, termed native CRP (nCRP), which can irreversibly dissociate at sites of inflammation and infection into five separate monomers, termed monomeric CRP (mCRP). CRP is synthesized primarily in liver hepatocytes but also by smooth muscle cells, macrophages, endothelial cells, lymphocytes, and adipocytes. Evidence suggests that estrogen in the form of hormone replacement therapy influences CRP levels in the elderly. Having been traditionally utilized as a marker of infection and cardiovascular events, there is now growing evidence that CRP plays important roles in inflammatory processes and host responses to infection including the complement pathway, apoptosis, phagocytosis, nitric oxide (NO) release, and the production of cytokines, particularly interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α. Unlike more recent publications, the findings of early work on CRP can seem somewhat unclear and at times conflicting since it was often not specified which particular CRP isoform was measured or utilized in experiments and whether responses attributed to nCRP were in fact possibly due to dissociation into mCRP or lipopolysaccharide contamination. In addition, since antibodies for mCRP are not commercially available, few laboratories are able to conduct studies investigating the mCRP isoform. Despite these issues and the fact that most CRP research to date has focused on vascular disorders, there is mounting evidence that CRP isoforms have distinct biological properties, with nCRP often exhibiting more anti-inflammatory activities compared to mCRP. The nCRP isoform activates the classical complement pathway, induces phagocytosis, and promotes apoptosis. On the other hand, mCRP promotes the chemotaxis and recruitment of circulating leukocytes to areas of inflammation and can delay apoptosis. The nCRP and mCRP isoforms work in opposing directions to inhibit and induce NO production, respectively. In terms of pro-inflammatory cytokine production, mCRP increases interleukin-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 production, whereas nCRP has no detectable effect on their levels. Further studies are needed to expand on these emerging findings and to fully characterize the differential roles that each CRP isoform plays at sites of local inflammation and infection.},

@article{steinerBriefPerspectiveInsulin2009,
	abstract = {The preeminent role of the beta cell is to manufacture, store and release insulin. The mature insulin molecule is composed of two polypeptide chains designated as A and B that are joined by two pairs of disulfide bonds with an additional intramolecular disulfide bond in the A chain. However, the two chains of the insulin molecule are not synthesized as separate polypeptide chains but rather are generated by specific proteolytic processing of a larger precursor, proinsulin. This discovery in 1967 and the concept of prohormones changed our view of the biosynthesis of hormones and neuropeptides. It allowed studies of the regulation of insulin biosynthesis that highlighted the key role of glucose. In addition, the C-peptide, the polypeptide that joins the A and B chains in proinsulin and is stored with insulin in the secretory granules and secreted in equimolar amounts, allowed studies of pancreatic β cell function in vivo including in patients with diabetes. Subsequent studies have identified the specific proteases, prohormone convertases 1/3 and 2 and carboxypeptidase E, that are involved in the conversion of proinsulin to proinsulin intermediates and then to insulin. Disorders of (pro)insulin biosynthesis continue to illuminate important aspects of this pathway, revealing important connections to diabetes pathogenesis. Recent studies of patients with insulin gene mutations that cause permanent neonatal diabetes have identified key residues affecting the folding and structural organization of the preproinsulin molecule and its subsequent processing. These findings have renewed interest in the key role of endoplasmic reticulum function in insulin biosynthesis and the maintainance of normal beta cell health.},

	abstract = {Human survival has relied upon the ability to withstand starvation through energy storage, the capacity to fight off infection by a proinflammatory immune response, and the ability to cope with physical stressors by an adaptive stress response. Energy storage, mainly as glycogen in liver and triglycerides in adipose tissue, is regulated by the anabolic actions of insulin. On the other hand, mobilization of stored energy during infection, trauma or stress is served by the temporary inhibition of insulin action (insulin resistance) in target tissues by proinflammatory cytokines and stress hormones. In the current environment, high energy intake, low physical activity, and chronic stress favor the storage of surplus fat in adipose tissue depots that far exceeds their storage capacity and liporegulation. Lipid overload in central fat depots initiates an inflammatory response and adipocyte dysfunction with resultant low-grade systemic inflammation and lipid overflow to peripheral tissues. In turn, proinflammatory cytokines and non-oxidized lipid metabolites, accumulated in liver and muscle cells, activate the mechanism of insulin resistance as would occur in the case of infection or stress. The same factors together with the ensuing insulin resistance further contribute to pancreatic β-cell dysfunction and ultimately to type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The present review supports the hypothesis that insulin resistance evolved as a physiological adaptive mechanism in human survival and that the same mechanism is inappropriately activated on a chronic basis in the current environment, leading to the manifestations of the metabolic syndrome.},

@article{vettorettiCombiningContinuousGlucose2019,
	abstract = {For individuals affected by Type 1 diabetes (T1D), a chronic disease in which the pancreas does not produce any insulin, maintaining the blood glucose (BG) concentration as much as possible within the safety range (70--180 mg/dl) allows avoiding short- and long-term complications. The tuning of exogenous insulin infusion can be difficult, especially because of the inter- and intra-day variability of physiological and behavioral factors. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) sensors, which monitor glucose concentration in the subcutaneous tissue almost continuously, allowed improving the detection of critical hypo- and hyper-glycemic episodes. Moreover, their integration with insulin pumps for continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion allowed developing algorithms that automatically tune insulin dosing based on CGM measurements in order to mitigate the incidence of critical episodes. In this work, we aim at reviewing the literature on methods for CGM-based automatic attenuation or suspension of basal insulin with a focus on algorithms, their implementation in commercial devices and clinical evidence of their effectiveness and safety.},

@article{wangGlycosylatedHemoglobinAssociated2020,
	abstract = {Background Diabetes is a risk factor for the progression and prognosis of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), but the relationship between glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level, inflammation, and prognosis of COVID-19 patients has not been explored. Methods This was a retrospective study of COVID-19 patients who underwent an HbA1c test. Their demographic data, medical history, signs and symptoms of COVID-19, laboratory test results, and final outcomes of COVID-19 treatment were collected and analyzed. Results A total of 132 patients were included and divided into three groups based on their blood glucose status. There were significant differences in SaO2, serum ferritin level, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), fibrinogen (Fbg) level, and IL6 level among the three groups. A pairwise comparison of the groups showed that groups B and C were significantly different from group A in terms of CRP, ESR, and Fbg, IL6, and serum ferritin levels (P~{$<~$}0.05). Correlation analysis showed that there was a linear negative correlation between SaO2 and HbA1c (r~=~−0.22, P~=~0.01), while there was a linear positive correlation between serum ferritin, CRP, Fbg, and ESR levels and HbA1c (P~{$<~$}0.05). Conclusions High HbA1c level is associated with inflammation, hypercoagulability, and low SaO2 in COVID-19 patients, and the mortality rate (27.7\%) is higher in patients with diabetes. Determining HbA1c level after hospital admission is thus helpful assessing inflammation, hypercoagulability, and prognosis of COVID-19 patients.},

This article explores two similar but underutilized theoretical frameworks in medical anthropology, and discusses how they facilitate new insights about the relationships between epidemiological patterns and individual-level illness experiences. Two cases from our fieldwork in New Delhi and Chicago are presented to illustrate how syndemics and chronicity theories explain the epidemic problems of co-occurring depression and type 2 diabetes. We use these case studies to illustrate how the holistic agendas of syndemics and chronicity theories allow critical scholars to attend to the macrosocial factors contributing to the rise of noncommunicable diseases while still honoring the diversity of experiences that make individual illness experiences, and actual outcomes, unique. Such an approach not only promotes a more integrative medical anthropology, but also contributes to global health dialogues around diabetes, depression, and their overlap.},

These enzymes have been implicated in a number of pathologies, including cancer, arthritis, atherosclerosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Thus, inhibitors of MMPs may have utility in the therapy of inflammatory diseases, particularly in arthritis where current therapies do not halt the progression of the disease. Many compounds have been identified as inhibitors of MMPs, and some have progressed to the clinic. However, no compound developed as an MMP inhibitor has been licensed for clinical use thus far. This review discusses this therapeutic area and compares inhibitors of MMPs with other novel therapeutic approaches in the treatment of inflammatory disease.

Objective This critical review aims to integrate the literature on stigma towards transgender people in the US. Results This review demonstrates that transgender stigma limits opportunities and access to resources in a number of critical domains (e.g., employment, healthcare), persistently affecting the physical and mental health of transgender people. The applied social ecological model employed here elucidates that transgender stigma operates at multiple levels (i.e., individual, interpersonal, structural) to impact health. Stigma prevention and coping interventions hold promise for reducing stigma and its adverse health-related effects in transgender populations. Conclusion Additional research is needed to document the causal relationship between stigma and adverse health as well as the mediators and moderators of stigma in US transgender populations. Multi-level interventions to prevent stigma towards transgender people are warranted.},

	abstract = {Background: An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, China; the epidemic is more widespread than initially estimated, with cases now confirmed in multiple countries. Aims: The aim of this meta-analysis was to assess the prevalence of comorbidities in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected patients and the risk of underlying diseases in severe patients compared to non-severe patients. Methods: A literature search was conducted using the databases PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science through February 25, 2020. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using random-effects models. Results: Seven studies were included in the meta-analysis, including 1 576 infected patients. The results showed the most prevalent clinical symptom was fever (91.3\%, 95\% CI: 86--97\%), followed by cough (67.7\%, 95\% CI: 59--76\%), fatigue (51.0\%, 95\% CI: 34--68\%) and dyspnea (30.4\%, 95\% CI: 21--40\%). The most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension (21.1\%, 95\% CI: 13.0--27.2\%) and diabetes (9.7\%, 95\% CI: 7.2--12.2\%), followed by cardiovascular disease (8.4\%, 95\% CI: 3.8--13.8\%) and respiratory system disease (1.5\%, 95\% CI: 0.9--2.1\%). When compared between severe and non-severe patients, the pooled OR of hypertension, respiratory system disease, and cardiovascular disease were 2.36 (95\% CI: 1.46--3.83), 2.46 (95\% CI: 1.76--3.44) and 3.42 (95\% CI: 1.88--6.22) respectively. Conclusion: We assessed the prevalence of comorbidities in the COVID-19 patients and found that underlying disease, including hypertension, respiratory system disease and cardiovascular disease, may be risk factors for severe patients compared with non-severe patients.},
