The scores `r star_df$math_mean` represent ( _in order_ ) the mean math scores for boys _without_, boys _with_, and girls _without_, and girls _with_ free or reduced price lunches in this data sample. The standard deviation of the math mean scores `r star_df$math_sd` represent ( _in order_ ) the standard deviation of math scores for boys _without_, boys _with_, and girls _without_, and girls _with_ free or reduced price lunches in this data sample. The  scores `r star_df$rdg_mean` represent the mean reading scores for boys _without_, boys _with_, and girls _without_, and girls _with_ free or reduced price lunches in this sample. And the standard deviation of reading scores `r star_df$rdg_sd` represent the standard deviation of reading scores for for boys _without_, boys _with_, and girls _without_, and girls _with_ free or reduced price lunches in this data sample.
